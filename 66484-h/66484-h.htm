<p>Transcriber's Note:</p>

<p>Obvious printer errors have been corrected. Hyphenation has been
rationalised.</p>

<p>The text is divided into fifty eight Chapters, which are grouped into
nine Parts. The Chapters are not identified in the Contents pages: they
mostly coincide with the topics noted there, though not with their
numbering. The numbering of pages is occasionally out of sequence,
generally when a topic is discussed more than once.</p>

<p>Both the Index and the Contents Pages use expressions that identify the
page number and section/subsection to which they relate. These
expressions are explained in the Note immediately before the Index.</p>

<p>A number of words and phrases are bolded in the original. These have
been bolded in this text. Where the original treatment is unclear a
guess has been necessary.</p>

<p>Passages in smaller font in Part IX (The Ritual), that describe
actions to be taken by a minister or the congregation, are indented.

</div>

<p>To the Members of the Colored Methodist
Episcopal Church:</p>

<p>We esteem it our duty and privilege most
earnestly to recommend to you, as members
of our Church, our form of Discipline,
which has been founded on the experience
of a long series of years.</p>

<p>We wish to see this publication in the
house of every member of the Colored Methodist
Episcopal Church; and the more so,
as it contains the Articles of Religion maintained
more or less, in part or in whole, by
every reformed Church in the world.</p>

<p>Far from wishing you to be ignorant of
any of our doctrines, or any part of our Discipline,
we desire you to read, mark, learn,
and inwardly digest the whole. You ought,
next to the Word of God, to procure the
Articles and Canons of the Church to which
you belong.</p>

<p>We deem it proper, in this place, to give
you a brief account of the organization of
our Connection:</p>

<p>From the introduction of Methodism on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
this continent, we have ever constituted a
part of the great Methodist family—first, as
members of the Methodist Episcopal Church
in America, and also after the change took
place by which we were known as the Methodist
Episcopal Church in the United States;
and when the division took place, in 1844,
which we regard as a legal and constitutional
division of the Church, we formed a
part of that division called the Methodist
Episcopal Church, South, which relation we
continued to sustain until the organization
of our Church took place at the General
Conference held at Jackson, Tenn., which
began its session December 15, 1870. The
day was spent in prayer and supplication to
the Almighty that his blessings might rest
upon us; and on the following day the regular
business of the session began, Bishop
Robert Paine, D. D., of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, South, in the chair.</p>

<p>The circumstances which led to our separate
and distinct organization were as follows:</p>

<p>When the General Conference of the Methodist
Episcopal Church, South, met in New
Orleans, April, 1866, the Conference found
that, by revolution and the fortunes of war,
a change had taken place in our political
and social relation, which made it necessary
that a change should also be made in our
ecclesiastical relations, and provision was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
made for our organization into separate congregations,
Districts, and Annual Conferences,
if we desired it; and that when two or
more Annual Conferences should be formed,
if it was our wish, and met the approbation
of the Bishops of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, South, we should have a General
Conference organization like that of the
Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and that
our preachers should receive ordination according
to the regulations and requirements
of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, as
Deacons and Elders; and should a General
Conference be organized, and suitable men be
elected to the office of Bishops, that the
Bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
South, would ordain and set them apart as
Chief Pastors among us. At the General Conference
of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
South, at Memphis, Tennessee, May, 1870, it
was found that five Annual Conferences had
been formed among us, and that an almost
universal desire had been expressed on our
part that we might be organized into a separate
and distinct Church, which was acquiesced
in by the Bishops of the Methodist
Episcopal Church, South, and recommended
to said Conference in their address; whereupon,
by our request, the Bishops of the
Methodist Episcopal Church, South, together
with A. L. P. Green, Samuel Watson, Edmund
W. Sehon, Thomas Whitehead, R. J.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
Morgan, and Thomas Taylor, were appointed
by said Conference to aid in organizing our
General Conference at the time and place
above specified. At the succeeding sessions
of our Annual Conferences, delegates
were elected to attend our General Conference,
in accordance with the Discipline of
the Methodist Episcopal Church, South.</p>

<p>It was further determined by the acts of
the General Conference of the Methodist
Episcopal Church, South, 1866, that should
the time arrive when we should be formed into
a separate and distinct organization, that
all property which was intended for the use
and benefit of people of color, held by the
Trustees of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
South, should be transferred to Trustees appointed
by us, to be held forever for our use
and benefit.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the facts in the case
that our record is clear, and that we have
descended regularly from the very father of
Methodism, and that our organization is both
legal and constitutional.</p>

<p>We remain your very affectionate brethren
and pastors, who labor night and day, both
in public and in private, for your good.</p>

 <h2><b>PART I</b><br />
 <small>THE CONSTITUTION</small></h2>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>

 <h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
 <small>ARTICLES OF RELIGION</small></h3>

<h4>I. OF FAITH IN THE HOLY TRINITY.</h4>

</div>

<p>There is but one living and true God,
everlasting, without body or parts; of
infinite power, wisdom, and goodness;
the maker and preserver of all things,
both visible and invisible. And in
unity of this Godhead, there are three
persons of one substance, power, and
eternity—the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost.</p>

<h4>II. OF THE WORD, OR SON OF GOD WHO
WAS MADE VERY MAN.</h4>

<p>The Son, who is the Word of the
Father, the very and eternal God, of
one substance with the Father, took
man's nature in the womb of the blessed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
Virgin; so that two whole and perfect
natures—that is to say, the Godhead
and manhood—were joined together
in one person, never to be divided,
whereof is one Christ, very God
and very man, who truly suffered, was
crucified, dead and buried, to reconcile
his Father to us, and to be a sacrifice,
not only for original guilt, but
also for actual sins of men.</p>

<h4>III. OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</h4>

<p>Christ did truly rise again from the
dead, and took again his body, with
all things appertaining to the perfection
of man's nature, wherewith he ascended
into heaven, and there sitteth
until he return to judge all men at the
last day.</p>

<h4>IV. OF THE HOLY GHOST.</h4>

<p>The Holy Ghost, proceeding from
the Father and the Son, is of one substance,
majesty, and glory, with the
Father and the Son, very and eternal
God.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></div>

<h4>V. THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE HOLY
SCRIPTURES FOR SALVATION</h4>

<p>The Holy Scriptures contain all
things necessary to salvation; so that
whatsoever is not read therein, nor
may be proved thereby, is not to be
required of any man, that it should be
believed as an article of faith, or be
thought requisite or necessary to salvation.
In the name of the Holy
Scripture, we do understand those
canonical books of the Old and New
Testament, of whose authority was
never any doubt in the Church.</p>

<p class="center small">THE NAMES OF THE CANONICAL BOOKS</p>

<p>Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,
Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges,
Ruth, The First Book of Samuel, The
Second Book of Samuel, The First
Book of Kings, The Second Book of
Kings, The First Book of Chronicles,
The Second Book of Chronicles, The
Book of Ezra, The Book of Nehemiah,
The Book of Esther, The Book of Job,
The Psalms, The Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,
or the Preacher, Cantica, or Songs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
of Solomon, Four Prophets the greater,
Twelve Prophets the less. All the
books of the New Testament, as they
are commonly received, we do receive
and account canonical.</p>

<h4>VI. OF THE OLD TESTAMENT</h4>

<p>The Old Testament is not contrary
to the New; for both in the Old and
New Testament everlasting life is offered
to mankind by Christ, who is
the only Mediator between God and
man, being God and man. Wherefore,
they are not to be heard who feign
that the old fathers did look only for
transitory promises. Although the law
given from God by Moses, as touching
ceremonies and rites, doth not bind
Christians, nor ought the civil precepts
thereof of necessity to be received in
any Commonwealth, yet, notwithstanding,
no Christian whatsoever is
free from the obedience of the commandments
which are called moral.</p>

<h4>VII. OF ORIGINAL OR BIRTH-SIN</h4>

<p>Original Sin standeth not in the following
of Adam, (as the Pelagians do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
vainly talk,) but it is the corruption
of the nature of every man, that naturally
is engendered of the offspring
of Adam, whereby man is very far gone
from original righteousness, and of his
own nature inclined to evil, and that
continually.</p>

<h4>VIII. OF FREE-WILL</h4>

<p>The condition of man after the fall
of Adam is such that he can not turn
and prepare himself, by his own natural
strength and works, to faith and
calling upon God; wherefore we have
no power to do good works, pleasant
and acceptable to God, without the
grace of God by Christ preventing us,
that we may have a good will, and
working with us, when we have that
good will.</p>

<h4>IX. OF THE JUSTIFICATION OF MAN</h4>

<p>We are accounted righteous before
God, only for the merit of our Lord
and Savior Jesus Christ, by faith, and
not for our own works or deservings;
wherefore, that we are justified by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
faith only, is a most wholesome doctrine,
and very full of comfort.</p>

<h4>X. OF GOOD WORKS</h4>

<p>Although good works, which are the
fruits of faith and follow after justification,
cannot put away our sins, and
endure the severity of God's judgment;
yet are they pleasing and acceptable
to God in Christ, and spring
out of a true and lively faith, insomuch
that by them a lively faith may be as
evidently known as a tree discerned
by its fruit.</p>

<h4>XI. OF WORKS OF SUPEREROGATION</h4>

<p>Voluntary works, besides over and
above God's commandments, which are
called works of supererogation, cannot
be taught without arrogancy and
impiety. For by them men do declare
that they do not only render unto God
as much as they are bound to do, but
that they do more for his sake than of
bounded duty is required; whereas
Christ saith plainly, When ye have
done all that is commanded you, say,
We are unprofitable servants.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></div>

<h4>XII. OF SIN AFTER JUSTIFICATION</h4>

<p>Not every sin willingly committed
after justification, is the sin against
the Holy Ghost, and unpardonable.
Wherefore, the grant of repentance is
not to be denied to such as fall into sin
after justification. After we have received
the Holy Ghost, we may depart
from grace given, and fall into sin,
and, by the grace of God, rise again
and amend our lives. And, therefore,
they are to be condemned who say they
can no more sin as long as they live
here, or deny the place of forgiveness
to such as truly repent.</p>

<h4>XIII. OF THE CHURCH</h4>

<p>The visible Church of Christ is a
congregation of faithful men, in which
the pure word of God is preached, and
the sacraments duly administered, according
to Christ's ordinance, in all
those things that of necessity are requisite
to the same.</p>

<h4>XIV. OF PURGATORY</h4>

<p>The Romanish doctrine concerning
purgatory, pardons, worshiping, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
adoration, as well of images as of
relics, and also invocation of saints, is
a fond thing, vainly invented, and
grounded upon no warrant of Scripture,
but repugnant to the word of
God.</p>

<h4>XV. OF SPEAKING IN THE CONGREGATION
IN SUCH A TONGUE AS THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND</h4>

<p>It is a thing plainly repugnant to the
word of God and the custom of the
Primitive Church, to have public prayer
in the Church or to minister the
sacraments in a tongue not understood
by the people.</p>

<h4>XVI. OF THE SACRAMENTS</h4>

<p>Sacraments, ordained of Christ, are
not only badges or tokens of Christian
men's profession, but rather they are
certain signs of grace, and God's good
will toward us, by the which he doth
work invisibly in us, and doth not only
quicken, but also strengthen and confirm
our faith in him.</p>

<p>There are two sacraments ordained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
of Christ our Lord in the Gospel; that
is to say, Baptism and the Supper of
the Lord.</p>

<p>Those five commonly called sacraments—that
is to say, Confirmation,
Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and Extreme
Unction—are not to be counted
for sacraments of the Gospel, being
such as have partly grown out of the
<b>corrupt</b> following of the apostles, and
partly are states of life allowed in the
Scriptures, but yet have not the like
nature of Baptism and the Lord's Supper,
because they have not any visible
sign or ceremony ordained of God.</p>

<p>The sacraments were not ordained of
Christ to be gazed upon, or to be carried
about; but that we should duly
use them. And in such only as worthily
receive the same, they have a
wholesome effect or operation; but
they that receive them unworthily purchase
to themselves condemnation, as
St. Paul saith, 1 Cor. xi. 29.</p>

<h4>XVII. OF BAPTISM</h4>

<p>Baptism is not only a sign of profession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
and mark of difference whereby
Christians are distinguished from others
that are not baptized; but it is also
a sign of regeneration, or the new
birth. The baptism of young children
is to be retained in the Church.</p>

<h4>XVIII. OF THE LORD'S SUPPER</h4>

<p>The Supper of the Lord is not only
a sign of the love that Christians ought
to have among themselves one to
another, but rather is a sacrament of
our redemption by Christ's death; insomuch
that, to such as rightly, worthily,
and with faith receive the same,
the bread which we break is a partaking
of the body of Christ; and likewise
the cup of blessing is a partaking
of the blood of Christ.</p>

<p>Transubstantiation, or the change
of the substance of bread and wine in
the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved
by Holy Writ, but is repugnant to
the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth
the nature of a sacrament,
and hath given occasion to many superstitions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
The body of Christ is given, taken,
and eaten in the Supper, only after a
heavenly and spiritual manner. And
the means whereby the body of Christ
is received and eaten in the Supper,
is faith.</p>

<p>The sacrament of the Lord's Supper
was not by Christ's ordinance reserved,
carried about, lifted up, or worshiped.</p>

<h4>XIX. OF BOTH KINDS</h4>

<p>The cup of the Lord is not to be
denied to the lay people; for both the
parts of the Lord's Supper, by Christ's
ordinance and commandment, ought
to be administered to all Christians
alike.</p>

<h4>XX. OF THE ONE OBLATION OF CHRIST,
FINISHED UPON THE CROSS</h4>

<p>The offering of Christ once made, is
that perfect redemption, propitiation,
and satisfaction for all the sins of the
whole world, both original and actual;
and there is none other satisfaction for
sin but that alone. Wherefore the sacrifice
of masses, in the which it is commonly
said that the priest doth offer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
Christ for the quick and the dead, to
have remission of pain or guilt, is a
blasphemous fable and dangerous deceit.</p>

<h4>XXI. OF THE MARRIAGE OF MINISTERS</h4>

<p>The ministers of Christ are not commanded
by God's law either to vow
the estate of single life or to abstain
from marriage; therefore it is lawful
to marry at their own discretion, as
for them, as for all other Christians,
they shall judge the same to serve best
to Godliness.</p>

<h4>XXII. OF THE RITES AND CEREMONIES OF
CHURCHES</h4>

<p>It is not necessary that rites and
ceremonies should in all places be the
same, or exactly alike; for they have
been always different, and may be
changed according to the diversity of
countries, times, and men's manners,
so that nothing be ordained against
God's word. Whosoever, through his
private judgment, willingly and purposely,
doth openly break the rites and
ceremonies of the Church to which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
belongs, which are not repugnant to
the word of God, and are ordained and
approved by common authority, ought
to be rebuked openly, that others may
fear to do the like, as one that offendeth
against the common order of the
Church, and woundeth the consciences
of weak brethren.</p>

<p>Every particular Church may ordain,
change, or abolish rights and
ceremonies, so that all things may be
done to edification.</p>

<h4>XXIII. OF THE RULERS OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA</h4>

<p>The president, the congress, the general
assemblies, the governors, and the
councils of state, <b>as the delegates of
the people</b> are the rulers of the United
States of America, according to the division
of power made to them by the
constitution of the United States, and
by the constitution of their respective
States. And the said States are a sovereign
and independent nation, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
ought not to be subject to any foreign
jurisdiction.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1" id="Ref_1" href="#Foot_1">[1]</a></span></p>

<h4>XXIV. OF CHRISTIAN MEN'S GOODS</h4>

<p>The riches and goods of Christians
are not common, as touching the right,
title, and possession of the same, as
some do falsely boast. Notwithstanding,
every man ought, of such things
as he possesseth, liberally to give alms
to the poor according to his ability.</p>

<h4>XXV. OF A CHRISTIAN MAN'S OATH</h4>

<p>As we confess that vain and rash
by our Lord Jesus Christ and James,
his apostle, so we judge that the Christian
religion doth not prohibit, but
that a man may swear when the magistrate
requireth, in a cause of faith
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
swearing is forbidden Christian men
and charity, so it be done according
to the prophet's teaching, in justice
judgment, and truth.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_1" id="Foot_1" href="#Ref_1">[1]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
As far as it respects civil affairs, we believe
it the duty of Christians and especially
all Christian ministers, to be subject to
the supreme authority of the country where
they reside, and to use all laudable means
to enjoin obedience to the powers that be;
and, therefore, it is expected that all our
preachers and people, who may be under any
foreign government, will behave themselves
as peaceable and orderly subjects.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
 <small>THE GENERAL RULES</small></h3>

<p>The General Rules of "The United
Societies" organized by Mr. Wesley
in 1739, are as follows:</p>

<p>There is only one condition previously
required of those who desire admission
into these societies, a "desire
to flee from the wrath to come, and to
be saved from their sins." But wherever
this is really fixed in the soul, it
will be shown by its fruits. It is
therefore expected of all who continue
therein that they shall evidence their
desire of salvation—</p>

<p>First, by doing no harm, by avoiding
evil of every kind, especially that
which is most generally practiced;
such as:</p>

<p>The taking of the name of God in
vain;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
The profaning the day of the Lord,
either by doing ordinary work therein,
or by buying or selling;</p>

<p>Drunkenness, or drinking spirituous
liquors unless in cases of necessity;</p>

<p><b>Fighting</b>, quarreling, brawling,
brother <b>going to law</b> with brother, returning
evil for evil, or railing for
railing; the <b>using many words</b> in buying
or selling.</p>

<p>The <b>buying or selling goods that
have not paid the duty</b>;</p>

<p>The <b>giving or taking things on usury</b>,
i.e., unlawful interest;</p>

<p><b>Uncharitable or unprofitable</b> conversation,
particularly, speaking evil of
magistrates or of ministers;</p>

<p>Doing to others as we would not
they should do unto us;</p>

<p>Doing what we know is not for the
glory of God: as,</p>

<p>The <b>putting on of gold and costly
apparel</b>;</p>

<p>The <b>taking such diversions</b> as can
not be used in the name of the Lord
Jesus;</p>

<p>The <b>singing</b> those <b>songs</b>, or <b>reading</b>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
those <b>books</b>, which do not tend to the
knowledge or love of God;</p>

<p>Softness or needless self-indulgence;</p>

<p>Laying up treasure upon earth;</p>

<p>Borrowing without a probability of
paying, or taking up goods without a
probability of paying for them.</p>

<p>It is expected of all who continue in
these societies, that they should continue
to evidence their desire of salvation—</p>

<p>Secondly, by doing good, by being
in every kind merciful after their power,
as they have opportunity, doing
good of every possible sort, and as far
as possible, to all men;</p>

<p>To their bodies, of the ability which
God giveth, by giving food to the hungry,
by clothing the naked, by visiting
or helping them that are sick or in
prison;</p>

<p>To their souls, by instructing, reproving,
or exhorting all we have any
intercourse with, trampling under foot
that enthusiastic doctrine that we are
not to do good unless <b>our hearts be
free to do it</b>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
By doing good, especially to them
that are of the household of faith, or
groaning so to be, employing them
preferably to others, buying one of
another, helping each other in business;
and so much the more because
the world will love its own, and them
<b>only</b>.</p>

<p>By all possible diligence and <b>frugality</b>,
that the gospel be not blamed.
By running with patience the race
which is set before them, <b>denying
themselves, and taking up their cross
daily</b>; submitting to bear the reproach
of Christ, to be as the filth and off-scouring
of the world; and looking that
men should say <b>all manner of evil of
them falsely for the Lord's sake</b>.</p>

<p>It is expected of all who desire to
continue in these societies that they
should continue to evidence their desire
of salvation—</p>

<p>Thirdly, by attending upon all the
ordinances of God, such as;</p>

<p>The public worship of God;</p>

<p>The ministry of the word, either
read <b>or</b> expounded;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
The Supper of the Lord;</p>

<p>Family and private prayer;</p>

<p>Searching the Scriptures, and</p>

<p>Fasting or abstinence.</p>

<p>These are the General Rules of our
societies; all of which we are taught
of God to observe, even in his written
word, which is the only rule, and the
sufficient rule, both of our faith and
practice. And all these we know his
Spirit writes on truly awakened hearts.
If there be any among us who observe
them not, who habitually break any
of them, let it be known unto them
who watch over that soul, as they
who must give an account. We will
admonish him of the error of his ways;
we will bear with him for a season;
but if then he repent not, he hath no
more place among us; we have delivered
our own souls.</p>

<p>Ans. 1. The General Conference
shall be composed of one clerical member
for every twenty-eight members
of each Annual Conference, and one
lay member (who may be a local
preacher) for each Annual Conference,
to be appointed as follows:</p>

<p>The clerical representatives shall be
elected by the clerical members of the
Annual Conference: <b>provided</b> that
such representatives shall have traveled
at least four calendar years from
the time they were received on trial,

<b>provided</b> that such representatives

<p>2. An Annual Conference, entitled
under the second Restrictive Rule to
two ministerial delegates, shall not be
denied the privilege of two lay delegates
also.</p>

<p>3. The ministers and laymen shall
deliberate in one body; but upon a
call of one-fifth of the members of the
Conference, the lay and clerical members
shall vote separately, and no
measure shall be passed without the
concurrence of a majority of both
classes of representatives.</p>

<p>4. The General Conference shall
meet in the month of May, once in
four years perpetually, in such place
or places as shall be fixed on by the
General Conference from time to time.</p>

all the Annual Conferences shall have
authority to call a General Conference,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
if they judge it necessary, at
any time.</p>

<p>6. When a General Conference is
called, it shall be constituted of the
delegates elected to the preceding General
Conference, except when an Annual
Conference shall prefer to have
a new election. The place of holding
a called session of the General Conference
shall be that fixed by the preceding
General Conference.</p>

<p>7. The Bishops shall have authority,
when they judge it necessary, to
change the place appointed for the
meeting of the General Conference.</p>

<p>8. At all times when the General
Conference is met, it shall take a majority
of the representatives of all the
Annual Conferences to make a quorum
for transacting business.</p>

<p>9. One of the general superintendents
shall preside in the General Conference;
but in case no general superintendent
be present, the General Conference

tem</b>.</p>

<p>10. The General Conference shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
have full powers to make rules and
regulations for our Church under the
following limitations and restrictions,
viz:</p>

 <p class="subpara">(1) The General Conference shall not revoke, alter, or change our
 Articles of Religion, or establish any new standards or rule of
 doctrine contrary to our present existing and established standards of
 doctrine.</p>

 <p class="subpara">(2) They shall not allow of more than one representative for every
 fourteen members of the Annual Conference, nor allow of a less number
 than one for every thirty; <b>provided</b>, nevertheless, that when
 there shall be in any Annual Conference a fraction of two-thirds the
 number which shall be fixed for the ratio of representation, such
 Annual Conference shall be entitled to an additional delegate for such
 fraction; and <b>provided</b>, also, that no Conference shall be denied
 the privilege of two delegates.</p>

 <p class="subpara"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
 (3) They shall not change or alter any part or rule of our government,
 so as to do away with episcopacy, or destroy the plan of our itinerant
 general superintendency.</p>

 <p class="subpara">(4) They shall not revoke or change the General Rules of the United
 Societies.</p>

 <p class="subpara">(5) They shall not do away with the privilege of our ministers or
 preachers of trial by a committee and of an appeal; neither shall they
 do away with the privileges of our members of trial before the Church
 or by a committee, and of an appeal.</p>

<p><b>Provided</b>, nevertheless, that upon the
concurrent recommendation of three-fourths
of all the members of the several
Annual Conferences, who shall be
present and vote on such recommendation,
then a majority of two-thirds
of the General Conference succeeding
shall suffice to alter any of the above
restrictions, excepting the first article;
and also, whenever such alterations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
shall have been first recommended by
two-thirds of the General Conference,
so soon as three-fourths of the members
of all the Annual Conferences
shall have concurred as aforesaid, such
alteration or alterations shall take
effect.</p>

<p><b>Provided</b>, that when any rule or
regulation is adopted by the General
Conference, which, in the opinion of
the Bishops, is unconstitutional, the
Bishops may present to the Conference
which passed said rule or regulation,
their objections thereto, with their
reasons, in writing; and if then the
General Conference shall, by a two-thirds
vote, adhere to its action on
said rule or regulation, it shall then
take the course prescribed for altering
a restrictive rule, and thus passed
upon affirmatively, the Bishops shall
announce that such rule or regulation
takes effect from that time.</p>

to hold a Church Conference,
over which the preacher in charge shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
preside. It may be held at any time
most convenient for assembling the
greatest number of members; but if
on the Sabbath, it should not interfere
with the morning public worship.</p>

<p>2. A secretary shall be elected annually,
at the first meeting after the
session of the Annual Conference. He

<p>3. The roll of members shall be called
at every meeting, unless otherwise
ordered, and the Conference may
strike off the names of any who, on account
of removal or other causes, have
been lost sight of for twelve months;

may be restored by a vote of the meeting.</p>

<p>4. The following is suggested as the

<p>5. If the observance of this order of
business is likely to protract the session
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
beyond a reasonable limit, the
president may, from time to time, select
the most important matters and
bring them forward.</p>

<p>6. Let the Church Conference be
opened and closed with religious service,
and conducted in a devout and
prayerful spirit.</p>

by the Bishops, before a committee appointed
by the Bishop for the purpose.</p>

<p>3. The Annual Conference may then
admit him as a probationer by a vote
of the majority. Observe taking on
trial is entirely different from admitting
a preacher into full connection.
One on trial may be, either admitted
or rejected without doing him any
wrong; otherwise it would be no trial
at all.</p>

<h4>II. ADMITTING PREACHERS INTO FULL CONNECTION</h4>

<p>Ques. Who shall be admitted into
the Conference in full connection?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. No one except a preacher
who has been employed two successive
years in the regular itinerant work,
(which is to commence from his being
admitted on trial at the Annual Conference,)
and who is approved by the
Annual Conference.</p>

<p>2. Before any preacher is admitted
into full connection, he shall have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
passed an approved examination upon
the Course of Study prescribed by the
Bishops for candidates for the ministry;
and in no case shall a vote be taken
to admit any one until he is recommended
by the examining committee.</p>

<p>3. A missionary employed on a foreign
mission may be admitted into full
connection, if recommended by the
superintendent of the mission where
he labors, without being present at
the Annual Conference for examination.</p>

<p>Ques. 2. What method do we use in
admitting a preacher into full connection
at the Conference?</p>

<p>Ans. After solemn fasting and
prayer, every person proposed shall
then be asked before the Conference
the following questions, (with any,
others which may be thought necessary),
namely: Have you faith in
Christ? Are you going on to perfection?
Are you groaning after it? Are
you resolved to devote yourself wholly
to God and his work? Are you
willing to conform to the Discipline of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
the Church? Will you diligently instruct
the children in every place? Will
you visit from house to house? Will
you recommend fasting, or abstinence,
both by precept and example? Will
you especially observe the following
directions?—</p>

<p>1. Be diligent. Never be unemployed.
Never be triflingly employed.
Never trifle away time; neither spend
any more time at any place than is
strictly necessary.</p>

<p>2. Be punctual. Do every thing exactly
at the time. And do not mend
our rules, but keep them; not for
wrath, but conscience's sake.</p>

<p>3. Act in all things not according
to your own will, but as a son in the
gospel. It is therefore your duty to
employ your time in the manner which
we direct; in preaching, meeting the
classes, visiting from house to house,
and especially visiting the sick; in
reading, meditation and prayer. Above
all, if you labor with us in the
Lord's vineyard, it is needful you
should do that part of the work which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
we advise at those times and places
which we judge best for his glory.</p>

<p>If he gives satisfactory answers to
these questions, the Conference, by a
vote of the majority, may admit him
into full connection.</p>

<h4>III. ELECTION TO DEACON'S ORDERS</h4>

<p>Ques. 1. How is a deacon constituted?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. By the election of a majority
of the Annual Conference, and the
laying on of the hands of a Bishop.</p>

<p>2. Before any traveling preacher is
ordained deacon, he shall have passed
an approved examination upon the
Course of Study prescribed by the
Bishops for candidates for the ministry;
and in no case shall a vote be
taken to elect any one to deacon's orders
until he is recommended by the
examining committee.</p>

<p>Ques. 2. What shall be the time of
probation of a traveling preacher for
the office of a deacon?</p>

<p>Ans. No one shall be so elected and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
ordained who has not been one year
in the regular itinerant work, except
such as may be selected by the Bishop
for missionary work, when the Annual
Conference shall have authority to
elect to the deacon's office sooner, if
the Conference judge it expedient.</p>

<p>Ques. 3. What are the duties of a
Traveling Deacon?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. To administer baptism and
to perform the office of matrimony, in
the absence of the Elder.</p>

<p>2. To assist the Elder in administering
the Lord's Supper.</p>

<p>3. To do all the duties of a traveling
preacher.</p>

<h4>IV. ELECTION OF DEACONS TO ELDER'S ORDERS.</h4>

<p>Ques. 1. How is an Elder constituted?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. By the election of a majority
of the Annual Conference, and the
laying on of the hands of a Bishop
and some of the Elders that are present.</p>

<p>2. Before any traveling preacher is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
ordained Elder, he shall have passed
an approved examination upon the
Course of Study prescribed by the
Bishops for candidates for all the ministry;
and in no case shall a vote be
taken to elect any one to Elder's Orders
until he is recommended by the
examining committee.</p>

<p>Ques. 2. What shall be the time of
probation of a traveling deacon for
the office of an Elder?</p>

<p>Ans. Every traveling deacon shall
exercise that office for two years, before
he is eligible to the office of Elder;
except in the case of missionaries,
when the Annual Conference shall
have authority to elect to the Elder's
office sooner, if the Conference judge
it expedient;</p>

<p><b>Provided</b>, always, that when a
preacher has passed his examination,
and been elected to deacon's orders,
but fails of his ordination through the
absence of a Bishop, his eligibility to
the office of Elder shall run from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
time of his election to the office of
Deacon.</p>

<p>Ques. 3. What are the duties of a
traveling Elder?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. To administer baptism and
the Lord's Supper and to perform the
rite of matrimony, and conduct all
parts of Divine worship.</p>

<p>2. To do all the duties of a traveling
preacher.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XII.<br />
 <small>SUPERNUMERARY AND SUPERANNUATED PREACHERS—<br />
 PREACHERS FROM OTHER CHURCHES</small></h3>

<h4>I. SUPERNUMERARY PREACHERS</h4>

<p>Ques. What is a supernumerary
preacher?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. A supernumerary preacher
is one who is so disabled by affliction
as to be unable to preach constantly,
but is willing to do any work in the
ministry which the Bishop may direct,
and he may be able to perform.</p>

<p>2. A supernumerary preacher who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
refuses to attend to the work assigned
him, unless in case of sickness or other
unavoidable cause or causes, shall not
be allowed to exercise the functions of
his office, nor even to preach among
us; nevertheless, the final determination
of the case shall be with the Annual
Conference of which he is a member,
which shall have power to acquit,
suspend, locate, or expel him, as the
case may be.</p>

<h4>II. SUPERANNUATED PREACHERS.</h4>

<p>Ques. What is a superannuated
preacher?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. A superannuated preacher
is one who is worn out in the itinerant
service.</p>

<p>2. A superannuated preacher, living
out of the bounds of the Conference of
which he is a member, shall be held
responsible to the Annual Conference
within whose bounds he may reside,
which shall have power to try, acquit,
suspend or expel him, in the same
manner as if he were a member of
said Conference.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></div>

<h4>III. RECEIVING PREACHERS FROM OTHER CHURCHES</h4>

<p>Ques. 1. How shall we receive those
ministers who may offer to unite with
us from other Christian Churches?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. Ministers of other Churches
who may desire to unite with us as
local preachers, may be received by a
Quarterly Conference, upon giving satisfaction
that they are suitable persons;
but they shall not exercise the
peculiar functions of deacons or elders
until their orders are recognized by
the Annual Conference:</p>

<p><b>Provided</b>, no one who has been expelled
from the ministry and membership
of another Church shall be permitted
to enter our itinerancy under
five years from date of said expulsion.</p>

<p><b>Provided</b>, that the Bishop may, at
his discretion, allow ministers thus received
to exercise their functions as
Deacons or Elders until the session of
the Annual Conference.</p>

<p>2. After such reception, and a recommendation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
by the Quarterly Conference,
the Annual Conference, if satisfied
of their being in order, and of
their agreement with us in doctrine
and discipline, and also of their gifts,
graces and usefulness, may recognize
them accordingly, without the re-imposition
of hands, on condition of their
taking upon them our ordination vows.
If they cannot attend the Annual Conference,
they shall send up a certified
subscription to our doctrines and discipline,
and to our ordination vows.</p>

<p>3. Ministers of other Churches, duly
accredited as Deacons or Elders, who
may desire to unite with us as traveling
preachers, may be admitted as Deacons
or Elders in full connection, after
they shall have been members of
the Quarterly Conference at least one
year, and procuring a recommendation
from the Quarterly Conference:
<b>provided</b>, the Conference is satisfied
with their gifts, graces and usefulness,
and their agreement with us in doctrine
and discipline, on condition of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
their taking upon them our ordination
vows, without the re-imposition of
hands.</p>

<p>4. When a minister has been received
and recognized in orders, he shall
be furnished with a certificate, signed
by one of our Bishops, in the following
words, viz:</p>

<pre>

     This is to certify that..............
     has been admitted into...............
     Conference as a traveling preacher (or
     has been received as a local preacher

 <h3>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
 <small>THE CALL TO PREACH</small></h3>

</div>

<p>Ques. 1. How shall we try those who
profess to be moved by the Holy Ghost
to preach?</p>

<p>Ans. Let the following questions be
asked, namely:</p>

<p>1. Do they know God as a pardoning
God? Have they the love of God
abiding in them? Do they desire nothing
but God? And are they holy in
all manner of conversation?</p>

<p>2. Have they gifts (as well as graces)
for the work? Have they (in some
tolerable degree) a clear, sound understanding,
a right judgment in the
things of God, a just conception of
salvation by faith? Do they speak
justly, readily, clearly?</p>

<p>3. Have they fruit? Are any truly
convinced of sin and converted to
God by their preaching?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
As long as these three marks concur
in any one, we believe he is called of
God to preach. These we receive as
sufficient proof that he is moved by the
Holy Ghost.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
 <small>LOCAL PREACHERS AND EXHORTERS</small></h3>

<p>Ans. 1. The Quarterly Conference

their gifts, graces and usefulness
will warrant it.</p>

<p>2. No person shall be licensed to
preach without the recommendation of
the Church of which he or she is a
member, or of the Leaders' Meeting of
the charge to which he or she belongs.
Nor shall any one be licensed to preach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
without first being examined in the
Quarterly Conference on the subject
of doctrines and discipline, and giving

probation of a local preacher for the
office of a deacon?</p>

in doctrine, discipline, talents and usefulness,
signed by the President and
Secretary. He shall present to the Annual
Conference such recommendation,
with a note certifying his belief in

the Annual Conference; and if approved,
he may be ordained.</p>

<p>Ques. 4. What further directions are
given concerning local preachers?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. It shall be the duty of local
preachers to aid the preacher in charge
of the circuit, station, or mission to
which they belong in supplying the
people with the ministry of the word.
They shall subscribe annually for the
Christian Index, and their license shall
not be renewed by the Quarterly Conference
until they shall have subscribed
for the same. They shall accordingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
be applied to by the preacher in
charge as soon as he enters his work,
to state what amount of service they
are able and willing to perform; he
may then draw up a plan by which
their labors shall be regulated.
They shall be authorized to form new
congregations, to take a list of the
names of all candidates for Church
membership, and, if expedient, receive
them into the Church; <b>provided</b>, that
all such congregations, candidates, and
members be reported as soon as possible
to the preacher in charge, in order
that they may be placed immediately
under his pastoral care.</p>

<p>2. Every local elder, deacon, and licentiate

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
4. When a local elder, deacon or licentiate
removes from one circuit, station
or mission, to another, he shall
procure from the Presiding Elder of
the District or from the Preacher having
charge, a certificate of his official
standing in the Church at the time
of his removal; without which he shall
not be received as a local preacher in
other places.</p>

<h4>II. EXHORTERS</h4>

<p>Ques. 1. What directions are given
concerning the licensing of persons to
exhort?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. The Quarterly Conference

persons to exhort, and to renew their
license annually, when, in its judgment,
their gifts, graces and usefulness
will warrant it.</p>

exercise the functions of his office
without assuming those of a preacher.</p>

office, shall be a member of the Quarterly
Conference of the charge to
which he belongs; but in all other respects
he shall be dealt with as a private
member of the Church.</p>

<p>3. When an exhorter removes from
one circuit, station or mission to another,
he shall not be recognized as such
unless he obtains a certificate of his
official character from the Presiding
Elder of the District, or the preacher
to whose charge he belongs at the
time of his removal.</p>

him as is demanded, or the creditor
will accept.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
 <small>HOW TO RECEIVE MEMBERS.</small></h3>

</div>

<p>Ques. How shall members be received
into the Church?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. When persons offer themselves
for Church-membership, let the
preacher in charge inquire into their
spiritual condition, and receive them
into the Church when they have given
satisfactory assurances of their desire
to flee from the wrath to come, and to
be saved from their sins; and also, of
the genuineness of their faith, and of
their willingness to keep the rules of
the Church.</p>

<p>2. When satisfied on these points, let
the minister bring the candidates before
the congregation, whenever practicable,
and receive them according
to the prescribed form.</p>

<p>3. If a member in good standing in
any other Church shall desire to unite
with us, such applicant may, by giving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
satisfactory answers to the usual inquiries
be received without these formalities.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
 <small>ORDER AND DIRECTIONS FOR PUBLIC WORSHIP</small></h3>

<p>Ques. 1. What directions are given
for uniformity in public worship?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. The morning service shall
be conducted in the following order:</p>

<h4>ORDER OF PUBLIC WORSHIP</h4>

 <p class="subpara">1. Organ voluntary or song.</p>

  <p class="subpara">2. Singing, congregation standing.</p>

  <p class="subpara">3. Repeating "Apostles' Creed."</p>

  <p class="subpara">4. Prayer—closing with Lord's prayer, repeated or chanted.</p>

  <p class="subpara">5. Singing—anthem or hymn.</p>

  <p class="subpara">6. Reading lessons out of the Old and the New Testament—with chant by
  choir or suitable song between the lessons.</p>

  <p class="subpara">7. Announcements and notices.</p>

  <p class="subpara"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
  8. Singing—congregation sitting.</p>

  <p class="subpara">9. Preaching.</p>

  <p class="subpara">10. Singing—congregation standing.</p>

  <p class="subpara">11. Prayer.</p>

  <p class="subpara">12. Doxology and benediction.</p>

<p>2. The afternoon and evening services
shall be the same as the morning,
except that one of the lessons, or both,
may be omitted, at the discretion of
the minister.</p>

<p>3. The Lord's Supper shall be administered
monthly, in every congregation,
wherever it is practicable; and
where it is not, at every quarterly
meeting. Let the service preceding
the administration be so proportioned
as to admit of due time for this solemn
ordinance.</p>

<p>4. Let the Lord's Prayer be used on
all occasions of public worship, in concluding
the first morning prayer, the
congregation repeating after the minister;
and the apostolic benediction
(2 Cor. xiii. 14) in dismissing the congregation.</p>

<p>5. The Ritual shall be invariably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
used in all the offices for which it is
prescribed.</p>

<p>Ques. 2. How shall we guard against
formality in singing?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. By choosing such hymns as
are proper for the occasion.</p>

<p>2. By not singing too much at once;
seldom more than five or six verses.</p>

<p>3. By suiting the tune to the words.</p>

<p>4. By often stopping short, when
the words are given out, and asking
the people: "Now, do you know what
you said last? Did you speak no
more than you felt?"</p>

<p>5. In all our congregations let the
people learn to sing, and use our own
Hymn and Tune Books.</p>

<p>6. Exhort every person in the congregation
to sing.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XX.<br />
 <small>OTHER MEETINGS OF THE CHURCH</small></h3>

<p>Ques. What directions are given
concerning our prayer meetings?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
Ans. Let the pastor hold prayer-meetings,
weekly, in every church
where it is practicable; and when he
cannot himself attend, let him engage
local preachers, exhorters, class-leaders,
and others, to hold them.</p>

<p>2. Let prayer-meetings be held also
at other places where there is a probability
of their doing good.</p>

<h4>II. CLASS MEETINGS</h4>

<p>Ques. 1. What directions are given
concerning class-meetings?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. Let the membership of every
church, wherever it is practicable,
be divided into smaller companies, called
classes, according to their respective
places of abode; and let the members
be exhorted to attend the meetings of
the same.</p>

<p>2. Two or more classes may meet at
the same time and place, at their own
option, and their leaders may alternate
in conducting the exercises.</p>

<p>3. The pastor shall visit every class
once a quarter, and report its condition
to the Quarterly Conference; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
let him hold general class-meetings as
often as he shall find it expedient.</p>

<p>Ques. 2. Can any thing be done in
order to make the class-meetings more
profitable?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. Change improper leaders.</p>

<p>2. Let the leaders frequently meet
each other's classes.</p>

<p>3. Let us observe which leaders are
the most useful; and let these meet
the other classes as often as possible.</p>

<h4>III. LOVE-FEASTS</h4>

<p>Ques. 1. What directions are given
concerning love-feasts?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. Love-feasts shall be held

the preacher in charge may consider
expedient, with closed doors, to which,
besides Church members, other serious
persons may be admitted by him.</p>

<p>2. In conducting the love-feast, after
singing and prayer, the preacher may
make a short address, setting forth the
nature and design of this institution;
every one present then partakes of a
little bread and water in token of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
brotherly love; the members then give
brief details of their religious experience;
and the meeting is closed with
singing and prayer.</p>

<p>Ques. 2. How often shall we permit
strangers to be present at our love-feasts?</p>

<p>Ans. Let them be admitted with the
utmost caution; and the same person
on no account above twice or thrice.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
 <small>CHILDREN OF THE CHURCH</small></h3>

<p>Ques. What directions are given
concerning the children of the Church?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. Let the minister diligently
instruct and exhort all parents to dedicate
their children to the Lord in baptism
as early as convenient.</p>

<p>2. In his pastoral visitations let him
pay special attention to the children;
speak to them personally and kindly
on experimental and practical godliness,
according to their capacity; pray
earnestly for them, and cause them to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
be faithfully instructed in the nature,
design, privileges, and obligations of
their baptism.</p>

<p>3. As soon as they comprehend the
responsibilities involved in a public
profession of faith in Christ, and give
evidence of a sincere and earnest determination
to discharge the same, see
that they be duly recognized as members
of the Church, agreeably to the
provisions of the Discipline.</p>

<p>4. Let our Catechisms be used as extensively
as possible, both in our Sunday-schools
and families; and let the
preachers faithfully enforce upon parents
and Sunday-school teachers the
great importance of instructing children
in the doctrines and duties of our
holy religion.</p>

<p>5. It shall be the special duty of the
preachers to form Bible-classes wherever
they can, for the instruction of
larger children and youth; and where
they cannot superintend them personally,
to appoint suitable leaders for
that purpose.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></div>

 <h3>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
 <small>THE SUNDAY-SCHOOL</small></h3>

<p>Ques. What directions are given
concerning Sunday-schools?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. Let Sunday-schools be formed
in all our congregations, where ten
children can be collected for that purpose.
And it shall be the especial
duty of preachers having charge of
circuits and stations, with the aid of
the other preachers, to see that this
be done; to engage the co-operation of
as many of our members as they can;
to visit the schools as often as practicable;
to preach on the subject of Sunday-schools
and religious instruction
in each congregation; to have the Superintendents
lay before the Quarterly
Conference, at each quarterly meeting,
to be entered on its journal, a written
statement of the number and state of
the Sunday-schools within their respective
circuits and stations, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
make a report of the same to their several
Annual Conferences.</p>

<p>2. Each Quarterly Conference shall
be deemed a Board of Managers, having
supervision of all the Sunday-school
Societies within its limits.</p>

<p>3. It is recommended that each Annual
Conference, where the general
state of the work will allow, request
the appointment of a special agent, to
travel throughout its bounds, for the
purpose of promoting the interests of
Sunday-schools and his expenses shall
be paid out of collections which he
shall be directed to make, or otherwise,
as shall be ordered by the Conference.</p>

<p>4. Let our Catechisms be used as extensively
as possible in our Sunday-schools;
and let the preachers faithfully
enforce upon Sunday-school teachers
the great importance of instructing
children in the doctrines and duties
of our holy religion.</p>

<p>5. The Superintendent of the Sunday-school
shall be nominated by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
preacher in charge, subject to the confirmation
or rejection of the Quarterly
Conference.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
 <small>TRIAL CODE OF A BISHOP</small></h3>

</div>

<p>Ques. 1. To whom is a Bishop amenable
for his conduct?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. To the General Conference
which has power to try him for improper
conduct and to acquit, suspend,
reprimand, retire with or without salary
or expel him.</p>

<p>Ques. 2. What provision is made for
the trial of a Bishop if he be accused
of immorality in the interval of the
General Conference?</p>

<p>Ans 2. When a bishop shall be under
a report or be accused of immorality,
three traveling elders shall, after
notice to him, carefully inquire
into the case and if they believe an investigation
necessary, they shall report
the matter to another bishop—and
it shall be his duty to call together
at some convenient place not fewer
than twelve (12) traveling elders—
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
and also the witnesses by whom the
accusation is expected to be established,
and the said elders shall be a committee
for the investigation of the
charge against the Bishop.</p>

<p>If the majority of them believe a
trial necessary, they shall suspend him
until the next General Conference.</p>

<p>The presiding Bishop shall cause an
exact record of the investigation, signed
by the president and secretary, to
be transmitted to the General Conference.
By this record and such other
testimony as may be obtained, the case
shall be considered and determined by
the General Conference without the intervention
of another committee. But
in no case shall the inquiring elders
be recognized as the accusers, but the
three elders afore-mentioned must act
wholly upon rumors and not personal
knowledge, and shall not take any further
part in the case.</p>

<p>Ques. 3. What provision is made for
the appeal of a Bishop who may be
suspended during the interval of the
General Conference?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
Ans. 3. There shall be a court of appeals
composed of fifteen (15) persons
appointed as follows: Two by each
Bishop and one by the fourteen (14)
appointed by the Bishops—one of the
Bishops shall be ex-officio president of
said court. The number composing
said court shall be increased at the
same ratio as the number of Bishops
may be increased until the number
composing the court shall reach twenty-five
(25), to which all appeals shall
be made by the accused who may have
been suspended in the interval of the
General Conference; said court shall
have the power to sustain the action of
the investigating committee, reverse
and remand, or reverse and dismiss.
In all cases their decisions shall be final
except when the action of the investigating
committee is sustained by it.</p>

<p>In said excepted case, the suspension
remains until the ensuing General
Conference.</p>

<p>The Bishop appointed to preside over
said court is hereby authorized, upon
the receipt of an appeal, from the decision
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
of any committee of investigation,
to cause to be appointed the fifteen
(15) members as above stated,
which said number will sit as an appellate
court as before stated at a
place most convenient to all parties
concerned.</p>

<p>But should an appeal reach the Bishop
within three months of the sitting
of the General Conference, the court
shall not be convened—but the case
takes its regular course.</p>

<p>Ques. 4. What provision is made for
the trial of a Bishop if he should be accused
during the session of the General
Conference?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. An accusation preferred
during the session of the General Conference
shall be referred for investigation
to a committee of twenty-five (25)
members of the General Conference to
be selected by the president. Of this
number, the accused shall have the
right of challenge for fifteen (15) of
the twenty-five (25) appointed by the
Bishop or president—and the committee
shall report to the General Conference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
whether or not a trial is necessary.</p>

<p>If the committee of investigation decides
that a trial is necessary, they
shall formulate charges and specifications
conforming them with the grade
of offense involved in the accusation
and shall appoint one or more of their
number to prosecute the case.</p>

<p>The bill of charges and specifications
shall be a part of the report of the
committee to the General Conference.
Every case to be tried under this process,
shall, upon finding of a bill of
charges, be referred to the Committee
on Episcopacy, who shall have full
power to try the case and whose decision
shall be final save as to the right
of appeal.</p>

<p>The said committee shall make a
written report to the General Conference
and deliver to the secretary the
whole record of the case with the decision
rendered.</p>

<p>2. A Bishop who shall be found
guilty by the committee on Episcopacy
shall have the right to appeal to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
the General Conference then in session
which shall finally determine the case.</p>

<p>3. No charge against a Bishop
shall be tried unless it be made in writing
with specifications signed by the
accusers—and a copy of the charge
with the specifications shall be delivered
to the accused in sufficient time
before the trial to enable him to make
all necessary preparation for his defense.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
 <small>TRIAL OF A TRAVELING PREACHER</small></h3>

<p>Ques. 1. To whom is a traveling
preacher amenable for his conduct?</p>

<p>Ans. To the Annual Conference,
which shall have power to try, acquit,
or expel him.</p>

<p>Ques. 2. What shall be done when
a traveling preacher is accused of immorality?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. When a traveling elder or
deacon is under report of being guilty
of some crime expressly forbidden in
the Word of God, if it be in the interval
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
of the Annual Conference, let the
Presiding Elder, in the absence of the
Bishop, call as many traveling preachers
as he shall think fit—at least three—and,
if possible, bring the accused
and the accuser face to face. If the
accused be clearly convicted, he shall
be suspended till the ensuing Annual
Conference. The Presiding Elder
shall cause an exact record of the investigation,
signed by the President
and Secretary, to be transmitted to
the Annual Conference, by which his
case shall be fully considered and determined.</p>

<p>If the accused be a Presiding Elder,
any three traveling Elders or Deacons
of his District may inquire into the
case, and if they judge it necessary
report to the Bishop, who shall appoint
a committee of at least three Elders,
from within the bounds of the
Annual Conference of which the accused
is a member; he shall also preside
at the investigation, or some traveling
Elder appointed by him; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
accused, if guilty, shall be suspended.</p>

<p>If the accused and the accuser cannot
be brought face to face, but the
supposed delinquent evades an investigation,
it shall be received as a presumptive
proof of guilt; and out of
the mouth of two or three witnesses he
shall be condemned, and be accordingly
suspended. Nevertheless, even in
that case, the Annual Conference shall
consider and determine the whole matter.</p>

<p>2. When the accusation is preferred
during the session of the Annual Conference,
it shall first be referred to a
committee of three traveling Elders
for investigation, who shall report to
the Conference whether or not they
judge a trial necessary. If the Conference
differ in judgment from the
committee, a new committee may be
appointed to inquire into the facts and
report.</p>

<p>The committee of investigation reporting
a case for trial, shall bring forward
the bill of charges in proper form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
and appoint one or more of their number
to prosecute it.</p>

<p>Every case to be tried shall be referred
to a committee of not less than
nine, nor more than thirteen, who, in
the presence of a Bishop or a chairman,
whom the President of the Conference
shall appoint, and one or more
of the Secretaries of the Conference,
shall have full power to try the case,
and their decision shall be final, save
as to the right of appeal: <b>provided</b>,
that the accused shall, upon good
grounds alleged, be allowed to challenge
five in a committee of nine, or
seven in a committee of thirteen, and
in the same ratio for any other number.
And the said committee shall
make a faithful report to the Conference,
in writing, and deliver up to the
Secretary the whole record of the case,
with the decision rendered.</p>

<p>Ques. 3. What shall be done in cases
of improper tempers, words, or actions?</p>

<p>Ans. The person so offending shall
be reprehended by his senior in office.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
Should a second transgression take
place, one, two, or three ministers or
preachers are to be taken as witnesses.
If he be not then cured, accusation
shall be preferred at the next Annual
Conference, and the accused shall be
dealt with as in a case of immorality.</p>

<p>Ques. 4. What shall be done with
those ministers or preachers who hold
and disseminate, publicly or privately
doctrines which are contrary to our Articles
of Religion?</p>

<p>Ans. Let the same process be observed
as in case of immorality; but
if the minister or preacher so offending
do solemnly engage not to disseminate
such erroneous doctrines in public or
in private, he shall be borne with till
his case be laid before the next Annual
Conference, which shall determine
the matter.</p>

<p>Ques. 5. What shall be done when
a traveling preacher is complained of
as being so unacceptable, inefficient, or
secular, as to be no longer useful in his
work?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. The Conference to which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
belongs shall investigate the case, and
if it appears that the complaint is well
founded, and he does not give the Conference
satisfaction that he will amend
or voluntarily retire, it may locate him
without his consent.</p>

<p>2. He shall be at liberty to defend
himself before the Conference in person,
or by his representative; and if
he be located in his absence, without
having been previously notified of an
intention thus to proceed against him,
he may apply to the Conference, at its
next session, to be heard in his defense,
and the matter shall be reconsidered
for that purpose.</p>

<p>Ques. 6. What shall be done in the
case of a preacher who refuses to attend
to the work assigned him?</p>

<p>Ans. No Deacon or Elder who
ceases to travel without the consent of
the Annual Conference, certified under
the hand of the President of the Conference,
except in case of sickness,
debility or other unavoidable circumstances,
shall, on any account, exercise
the peculiar functions of his office, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
even be allowed to preach among us;
but the final determination in all such
cases is with the Annual Conference.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in all the above mentioned
cases of trial and conviction, an
appeal to the Ministerial Court of Appeals
shall be allowed, if the condemned
person signifies to the President or
the Secretary of the Conference his intention
to appeal at the time of his
condemnation; or at any time within
two months thereafter.</p>

refuses to pass his character on that
ground?</p>

<p>Ans. The Quarterly Conference next
succeeding shall proceed to investigate
the case; and if it appears that the
complaint is well founded, and he does
not give the Conference satisfaction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
that he will amend or voluntarily retire,
the Conference may depose him
from the ministry. He shall be at liberty
to defend himself before the Conference
in person, or by his representative.
The President of the Quarterly
Conference shall have regular minutes
of the investigation taken which on being
read and approved, shall be signed
by himself and a majority of the
members of the Conference.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in all the above mentioned
cases of trial and conviction,
an appeal to the ensuing Annual Conference
shall be allowed, if the condemned
person signifies his intention
to appeal at the time of his condemnation,
or at any time thereafter when
he is informed thereof.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
 <small>TRIAL OF A MEMBER</small></h3>

<p>Ques. 1. How shall an accused member
be brought to trial?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. Before the church of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
he is a member, or a select number of
them, in the presence of a Bishop, Elder,
Deacon or Preacher, in the following
manner:</p>

<p class="subpara">(a) When a member of the Church
is under report of being guilty of some
crime expressly forbidden in the Word
of God, the preacher having charge
shall appoint a committee of three discreet
members, who shall investigate
the report, and if they judge a trial to
be necessary, they shall appoint one of
their number to prepare a bill of
charges and specifications, and also to
prosecute the case.</p>

<p class="subpara">(b) Upon the presentation of such
bill of charges, the preacher shall appoint
a committee of not less than five,
nor more than thirteen, before whom
the accused shall be duly cited to appear,
who shall have full power to try
the case; and if the accused be found
guilty by a majority of the committee,
let the preacher declare him suspended
or expelled. Nevertheless, the
preacher may, at his discretion, bring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
the case before the whole Church for
trial.</p>

<p class="subpara">(c) A copy of the charge and specifications
shall be delivered to the accused
a sufficient length of time before
the trial, to enable him to make all
necessary preparations for his defense;
and in case of trial before a committee,
he shall be allowed, upon good
reasons alleged, to challenge two in a
committee of five, and in like ratio for
any other number.</p>

<p class="subpara">(d) The preacher in charge shall
preside at the trial, and decide all
questions of law appertaining to or
growing out of the case. He shall, at
the commencement of the trial, appoint
a secretary, who shall take down regular
minutes of the evidence and proceedings,
which minutes, when read
and approved, shall be signed by the
president and the secretary.</p>

<p class="subpara">(e) If the accused person evades a
trial by absenting himself after sufficient
notice given him, and the circumstances
of the accusation be strong
and presumptive, let him be esteemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
as guilty, and be accordingly suspended
or expelled. Witnesses from without
shall not be rejected.</p>

<p>2. But in case of neglect of duties
of any kind—imprudent conduct, indulging
sinful tempers or words, dancing,
or disobedience to the order and
the Discipline of the Church; First,
let private reproof be given by a
preacher or leader; and if there be an
acknowledgement of the fault and
proper humiliation, the person may be
borne with. On a second offense, the
preacher or leader may take one or
two faithful friends. On a third offense,
let the case be brought before
the Church, or a select number; and if
there be no sign of real humiliation,
the offender must be cut off.</p>

<p>3. If a member of our Church endeavor
to sow dissension in any of
our societies, by inveighing against
either our doctrines or Discipline, such
person so offending shall be first reproved
by the senior minister or
preacher of his circuit; and if he persist
in such pernicious practices, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
shall be expelled from the Church.</p>

<p>Ques. 2. What shall be done in case
of disputes between members of the
Church?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. On any dispute between two
or more members of our Church, concerning
the payment of debts or otherwise,
which cannot be settled by the
parties concerned, the preacher in
charge shall inquire into the circumstances
of the case; and shall recommend
to the contending parties a reference,
consisting of one arbiter chosen
by the plaintiff, and another chosen
by the defendant; which two arbiters
so chosen shall nominate the third—the
three arbiters being members of
our Church.</p>

<p>2. But if one of the parties be dissatisfied
with the judgment given, such
party may apply to the ensuing Quarterly
Conference for a second arbitration;
and if the Quarterly Conference
see sufficient reason, they shall grant a
<b>second</b> arbitration, in which case each
party shall choose two arbiters, and
the four arbiters shall choose a fifth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
the judgment of the majority of whom
shall be final; and any person refusing
to abide by such judgment shall be
excluded from the Church.</p>

<p>3. And if any member of our
Church shall refuse, in cases of debt
or other disputes, to refer the matter
to arbitration, when recommended by
him who has the charge of the circuit,
or shall enter into a lawsuit with another
member before these measures
are taken, he shall be expelled, unless
the case be of such a nature as to require
and justify a process of law.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in all the above mentioned
cases of trial and expulsion, an
appeal to the ensuing Quarterly Conference
shall be allowed, if the condemned
person signifies to the pastor
his intention to appeal at the time of
his condemnation, or at any time
thereafter when he is informed thereof.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></div>

by the representative of the lower
Court. When the representatives of
the appellant and the Court below
have been heard, they retire and the
Court of Appeals deliberates and decides
the case.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXII.</h3>

<h4>I. SUPPORT OF PASTORS</h4>

</div>

<p>1. Every minister, who by the rules
and usages of the Church is a claimant
on its funds, shall, as far as practicable,
have his claim estimated by
those who are to pay it, or by an agent

each congregation is expected to pay.
The Church Conference shall adopt its
own method of raising this money.</p>

<h4>II. SUPPORT OF PRESIDING ELDERS</h4>

<p>1. The salary and traveling expenses
of Presiding Elders shall be estimated
by the Joint Board of Finance.</p>

shall add the sum, thus apportioned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
to the amounts agreed on to be raised
for their preachers, and its collection
shall be provided for in the same way.</p>

<h4>III. SUPPORT OF BISHOPS</h4>

<p>The Bishops shall be supported according
to the following plan:</p>

<p>1. The allowance of the Bishops for

per annum, to be paid quarterly
as other Bishops.</p>

<p>4. Those Bishops who are unable to
do full work shall be paid the same
amount and in the same way as those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
who are efficient and actively engaged

office, or by such other means as the
Conference may devise.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />
 <small>CHURCHES AND PARSONAGES</small></h3>

<h4>I. CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS</h4>

<p>Any church or churches in any Annual
Conference of the Colored Methodist
Episcopal Church in America,
shall have the right to establish an
OLD FOLKS' Home, ORPHAN ASYLUM,
HOSPITAL, or other charitable
institutions in conformity to the
laws of the State or Territory in which
they are located. The Trustees of all
such institutions shall be members of
the Colored M. E. Church, and shall
have authority to found, maintain and
operate such institutions in the name
of the C. M. E. Church in America.</p>

<h4>II. BUILDING CHURCHES</h4>

<p>Ques. Is anything advisable in regard
to building churches?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. Let all our churches be plain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span>
and decent, and with free seats, as far
as practicable; and they shall in no
wise be used for political purposes or
assemblages.</p>

<p>2. In order more effectually to prevent
our people from contracting debts
which they are not able to discharge,
it shall be the duty of the Quarterly
Conference of every circuit and station
where it is contemplated to build
a house of worship to secure the
ground or lot on which such house or
houses are to be built, according to
our deed of settlement, which deed
must be legally executed; and also
said Quarterly Conference shall appoint
a judicious committee of at least
three members of our church, who
shall form an estimate of the amount
necessary to build; and three-fourths
of the money, according to such estimate,
shall be secured or subscribed
before any such building shall be commenced.</p>

<p>3. In all cases where debts for building
houses of worship have been or
may be incurred contrary to, or in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
disregard of, the above recommendation,
our members and friends are requested
to discountenance by declining
pecuniary aid to all agents who
shall travel abroad beyond their own
circuits or districts for the collection
of funds for the discharge of such
debts, except in such peculiar cases as
may be approved by an Annual Conference.</p>

<p>4. In future, we will admit no charter,
deed, or conveyance for any house
of worship to be used by us, unless it
be provided in such charter, deed, or
conveyance, that the Trustees of said
house shall at all times permit such
ministers and preachers, belonging to
the Colored Methodist Episcopal
Church in America, as shall from time
to time be duly authorized by the General
Conference of our Church, or by
the Annual Conferences, to preach and
expound God's holy Word, and to execute
the Discipline of the Church, and
to administer the sacraments therein,
according to the true meaning and purport
of our deed of settlement.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></div>

<h4>III. BUILDING PARSONAGES</h4>

<p>Ques. What advice or direction is
given concerning the building of dwelling
houses for the use of the married
traveling preachers?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. It is recommended to our
friends in general, to purchase a lot
of ground in each pastoral charge, and
to build a preacher's house thereon,
and to furnish it with at least heavy
furniture, and to settle the same on
trustees appointed by the Quarterly
Conference, according to our deed of
settlement.</p>

<p>2. It shall be the duty of the Presiding
Elders and preachers to use
their influence to carry the above rules
respecting building houses, for the accommodation
of preachers and their
families, into effect. In order to do
this, each Quarterly Conference shall
appoint a committee, (unless other
measures have been adopted), who,
with the advice and aid of the preachers
and Presiding Elder, shall devise
such means as may seem fit to raise
money for that purpose. And it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
recommended to the Annual Conferences
to make a special inquiry of
their members respecting this part of
their duty.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br />
 <small>SECURING, SELLING, OR TRANSFERRING CHURCH PROPERTY.</small></h3>

<h4>1. SECURING CHURCHES AND PARSONAGES</h4>

<p>Ques. What shall be done for the
security of our preaching houses and
parsonages, and other Church property,
and the premises belonging thereto?</p>

<p>Ans. 1. Each Annual Conference is
authorized to make such modification
in the deeds as they may find the different
usages and customs of law require
in the different States and Territories,
so as to secure the property
firmly by deed, and permanently <b>in
fee simple</b>, to the Colored Methodist
Episcopal Church in America; but in
all conveyances of ground for the
building of houses of worship, or upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span>
which they may have been already
built, let the following clause be inserted
at the proper place: "In trust,
that said premises shall be used, kept,
maintained, and disposed of as a place
of Divine Worship for the use of the
ministry and membership of the Colored
Methodist Episcopal Church in
America; subject to the Discipline,
usage, and ministerial appointments
of said Church, as from time to time
authorized and declared by the General
Conference of said Church, and
the Annual Conference within whose
bounds the said premises are situated."</p>

<p>2. Likewise, in all conveyances of
ground for the building of dwelling
houses for the use of the preachers, or
upon which they may have been already
built, let the following clause
be inserted at the proper place: "In
trust, that said premises shall be held,
kept, and maintained and disposed of
as a place of residence for the use
and occupancy of the preachers of
the Colored Methodist Episcopal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
Church in America, who may from
time to time be appointed in said
place; subject to the usage and Discipline
of said Church, as from time
to time authorized and declared by the
General Conference of said Church,
and by the Annual Conference within
whose bounds the said premises are situated."</p>

<h4>II. DIVISION, TRANSFER, OR SALE OF
CHURCH PROPERTY</h4>

<p>1. When any circuit, station, or mission
shall be divided into two or more
charges, each separate charge may constitute
a new Board or Boards of Trustees;
and the Church property held by
the Trustees of the original charge
shall be conveyed to the new Boards
thus created, and the former Board or
Boards shall be freed from all pecuniary
liabilities, such being transferred
to the new Boards respectively.</p>

<p>2. The Trustees, with the consent of
the preacher in charge and the Quarterly
Conference, shall have power to
sell any church or parsonage property,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
which has gone out of use or should be
removed to another place, the proceeds
of which shall be under the direction
of the Quarterly Conference.</p>

<p>3. If the said Trustees, or any of
them, or their successors, have advanced,
or shall advance, any sum or sums
of money, or shall be responsible for
any sum or sums of money, on account
of Church property, and they, the
said Trustees, or their successors, be
obliged to pay the said sum or sums

 <h3>CHAPTER XLIX.<br />
 <small>THE ORDER FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LORD'S SUPPER</small></h3>

</div>

<p class="ritual">The Elder shall read one or more of these sentences, during the reading
of which the stewards shall take up the collection for the poor:</p>

<p>Let your light so shine before men,
that they may see your good works
and glorify your Father which is in
Heaven.—Matt. v. 16.</p>

<p>Lay not up for yourselves treasures
upon earth, where moth and rust doth
corrupt, and where thieves break
through and steal; but lay up for
yourselves treasures in heaven, where
neither moth nor rust doth corrupt,
and where thieves do not break
through nor steal.—Matt. vi. 19, 20.</p>

<p>Whatsoever ye would that men
should do to you, do ye even so to
them; for this is the law and the
prophets.—Matt. vii. 12.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></span></p>

<p>Not every one that saith unto me,
Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom
of heaven; but he that doeth the
will of my Father which is in heaven.—Matt.
vii. 21.</p>

<p>Zaccheus stood, and said unto the
Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my
goods I give to the poor; and if I
have taken any thing from any man
by false accusation, I restore him four-fold.—Luke
xix. 8.</p>

<p>He which soweth sparingly shall
reap sparingly; and he which soweth
bountifully shall reap also bountifully.
Every man as he purposeth in his
heart, so let him give not grudgingly,
or of necessity; for God loveth a cheerful
giver.—2 Cor. ix. 6, 7.</p>

<p>As we have therefore opportunity,
let us do good unto all men, especially
unto them who are of the household
of faith.—Gal. vi. 10.</p>

<p>Godliness with contentment is great
gain; for we brought nothing into this
world, and it is certain we can carry
nothing out.—1 Tim. vi. 6, 7.</p>

<p>Charge them that are rich in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">{263}</a></span>
world, that they be ready to distribute,
willing to communicate, laying up
in store for themselves a good foundation
against the time to come, that
they may lay hold on eternal life.
1 Tim. vi. 17, 18, 19.</p>

<p>God is not unrighteous to forget
your work and labor of love, which
ye have showed toward his name, in
that ye have ministered to the saints,
and do minister.—Heb. vi. 10.</p>

<p>To do good, and to communicate,
forget not; for with such sacrifices
God is well pleased.—Heb. xiii. 16.</p>

<p>Whoso hath this world's goods, and
seeth his brother have need, and shutteth
up his bowels of compassion from
him, how dwelleth the love of God in
him?—1 John iii. 17.</p>

<p>He that hath pity upon the poor,
lendeth unto the Lord; and that which
he hath given will he pay him again.—Prov.
xix. 17.</p>

<p>Blessed is he that considereth the
poor; the Lord will deliver him in
time of trouble.—Psalm xli. 1.</p>

<p class="ritual"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
Then shall the elder read this invitation</p>

<p>Ye that do truly and earnestly repent
of your sins, and are in love and
charity with your neighbors, and intend
to lead a new life, following the
commandments of God, and walking
from henceforth in his holy ways,
draw near with faith, and take this
holy sacrament to your comfort, and
make your humble confession to Almighty
God, meekly kneeling upon
your knees.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall the general confession be made
by the minister, in the name of all those
who are minded to receive the holy communion,
both he and all the people kneeling
humbly upon their knees and saying:</p>

<p>Almighty God, Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ, Maker of all things,
Judge of all men, we acknowledge and
bewail our manifold sins and wickedness,
which we from time to time most
grievously have committed, by
thought, word and deed, against thy
Divine Majesty, provoking most justly
thy wrath and indignation against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
us. We do earnestly repent, and are
heartily sorry for these our misdoings;
the remembrance of them is
grievous unto us. Have mercy upon
us, have mercy upon us, most merciful
Father: for thy Son our Lord Jesus
Christ's sake forgive us all that is
past, and grant that we may ever
hereafter serve and please thee in newness
of life, to the honor and glory of
thy name, through Jesus Christ our
Lord.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall the Elder say:</p>

<p>O Almighty God, our Heavenly Father,
who of thy great mercy hast
promised forgiveness of sins to all
them that with hearty repentance and
true faith turn to thee; have mercy
upon us; pardon and deliver us from
all our sins, confirm and strengthen us
in all goodness, and bring us to everlasting
life, through Jesus Christ our
Lord.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="center">THE COLLECT</p>

<p>Almighty God, unto whom all hearts
be open, all desires known, and from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
whom no secrets are hid; cleanse the
thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration
of thy Holy Spirit, that we may
perfectly love thee, and worthily magnify
thy holy name, through Christ
our Lord.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall the Elder say:</p>

<p>It is very meet, right, and our
bounden duty, that we should at all
times, and in all places, give thanks
unto thee, O Lord, Holy Father, Almighty,
Everlasting God.</p>

<p>Therefore with angels and archangels,
and with all the company of
heaven, we laud and magnify thy glorious
name, evermore praising thee,
and saying, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord,
God of hosts, heaven and earth are
full of thy glory. Glory be to thee, O
Lord most high.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall the Elder say:</p>

<p>We do not presume to come to this
thy table, O merciful Lord, trusting in
our own righteousness, but in thy manifold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
and great mercies. We are not
worthy so much as to gather up the
crumbs under thy table. But thou art
the same Lord, whose property is always
to have mercy; Grant us, therefore,
gracious Lord, so to eat the flesh
of thy dear Son Jesus Christ, and to
drink his blood that our sinful souls
and bodies may be made clean by his
death, and washed through his most
precious blood, and that we may evermore
dwell in him, and he in us.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then the Elder shall say the prayer of consecration as followeth:</p>

<p>Almighty God, our Heavenly Father,
who of thy tender mercy didst give
thine only Son Jesus Christ to suffer
death upon the cross for our redemption;
who made there (by his oblation
of himself once offered) a full, perfect,
and sufficient sacrifice, oblation,
and satisfaction for the sins of the
whole world; and did institute, and in
his holy Gospel command us to continue,
a perpetual memory of that his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">{268}</a></span>
precious death until his coming again:
hear us, O merciful Father, we most
humbly beseech thee, and grant that
we, receiving these thy creatures of
bread and wine, according to thy Son
our Saviour Jesus Christ's holy institution,
in remembrance of his death
and passion, may be partakers of his
most blessed body and blood; who in
the same night that he was betrayed
took bread; and when he had given
thanks, he brake it, and gave it to
his disciples, saying, Take, eat; this
is my body which is given for you: do
this in remembrance of me. Likewise
after supper he took the cup; and
when he had given thanks, he gave it
to them saying, Drink ye all of this;
for this is my blood of the New Testament,
which is shed for you and for
many, for the remission of sins; do
this, as oft as ye shall drink it, in remembrance
of me.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall the minister first receive the communion
in both kinds himself, and then
proceed to deliver the same to the other
minister in like manner, if any be present.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
Then shall he say the Lord's Prayer,
the people still kneeling and repeating after
him every petition:</p>

<p>Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed
be thy name; thy kingdom
come; thy will be done on earth, as it
is in heaven; give us this day our daily
bread; and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against
us; and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil; for
thine is the kingdom, and the power,
and the glory, forever and ever.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then a hymn may be sung, and the communicants shall be invited to the
table. The minister shall deliver both kinds to the people unto their
hands. When he delivereth the bread he shall say:</p>

<p>The body of our Lord Jesus Christ,
which was given for <b>thee</b>, preserve <b>thy
soul</b> and <b>body</b> unto everlasting life.
Take and eat this in remembrance that
Christ died for <b>thee</b>, and feed on him
in <b>thy heart</b> by faith with thanksgiving.</p>

<p class="ritual"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>
And the minister that delivereth the cup shall say:</p>

<p>The blood of our Lord Jesus Christ
which was shed for <b>thee</b>, preserve <b>thy
soul</b> and <b>body</b> unto everlasting life.
Drink this in remembrance that
Christ's blood was shed for thee, and
be thankful.</p>

<p class="ritual">When all have communed, the minister shall return to the Lord's table,
and place upon it what remaineth of the consecrated elements, covering
the same with a fair linen cloth.</p>

<p class="ritual">The minister may then say as followeth:</p>

<p>O Lord and Heavenly Father, we
thy humble servants desire thy fatherly
goodness mercifully to accept this
our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving,
most humbly beseeching thee to
grant that, by the merits and death of
thy Son Jesus Christ, and through
faith in his blood, we and thy whole
Church may obtain remission of our
sins. And here we offer and present
unto thee, O Lord, ourselves, our souls
and bodies, to be a reasonable, holy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
and lively sacrifice unto thee; humbly
beseeching thee that all we who are
partakers of this holy communion may
be filled with thy grace and heavenly
benediction. And although we be unworthy,
through our manifold sins,
to offer unto thee any sacrifice, yet we
beseech thee to accept this our bounden
duty and service; not weighing
our merits, but pardoning our offenses,
through Jesus Christ our Lord: by
whom, and with whom, in the unity of
the Holy Ghost all honor and glory be
unto thee, O Father Almighty, world
without end.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then may be said:</p>

<p>Glory be to God on high, and on
earth peace, good-will toward men.
We praise thee, we bless thee, we worship
thee, we glorify thee, we give
thanks to thee for thy great glory, O
Lord God, heavenly King, God the
Father Almighty.</p>

<p>O Lord, the only begotten Son, Jesus
Christ: O Lord God, Lamb of God, Son
of the Father, that takest away the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span>
sins of the world, have mercy upon us.
Thou that takest away the sins of the
world, have mercy upon us. Thou that
takest away the sins of the world, receive
our prayer. Thou that sittest
at the right hand of God the Father,
have mercy upon us.</p>

<p>For thou only art holy: thou only
art the Lord: thou only, O Christ, with
the Holy Ghost, art most high in the
glory of God the Father.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then the Elder, if he see it expedient, may put up an extemporaneous
prayer; and afterwards shall let the people depart with this blessing:</p>

<p>May the peace of God, which passeth
all understanding, keep your hearts
and minds in the knowledge and love
of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ
our Lord; and the blessing of God Almighty,
the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost, be among you, and remain
with you always.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">If the Elder be straitened for time, he may omit any part of the
service except the prayer of consecration.</p>

<p class="ritual"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></span>
If the consecrated bread or wine be all spent before all have
communed, the Elder may consecrate more, by repeating the prayer of
consecration.</p>

<p class="ritual">Let those who have scruples concerning the receiving of the communion
kneeling, be permitted to receive it either standing or sitting; but no
person shall be admitted to the Lord's Supper among us who is guilty of
any practice for which we would exclude a member of our Church.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER L.<br />
 <small>THE MINISTRATION OF BAPTISM TO INFANTS.</small></h3>

<p class="ritual">The minister, coming to the font, which is to be filled with pure
water, shall use the following, or some other suitable exhortation:</p>

<p>Dearly beloved, forasmuch as all
men are conceived and born in sin,
and that our Saviour Christ saith, Except
a man be born of water and of
the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
kingdom of God: I beseech you to call
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
upon God the Father, through our
Lord Jesus Christ, that of his bounteous
mercy he will grant to this <b>child</b>
that which by nature <b>he</b> cannot have;
that <b>he</b> may be baptized with water
and the Holy Ghost, and received into
Christ's holy Church, and be made a
lively member of the same.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall the minister say, Let us pray:</p>

<p>Almighty and everlasting God, we
beseech thee for thine infinite mercies,
that thou wilt look upon <b>this child</b>;
wash <b>him</b> and sanctify <b>him</b> with the
Holy Ghost that <b>he</b>, being delivered
from thy wrath, may be received into
the ark of Christ's Church, and being
steadfast in faith, joyful through hope,
and rooted in love, may so pass the
waves of this troublesome world, that
finally <b>he</b> may come to the land of
everlasting life, there to reign with
thee, world without end, through Jesus
Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>O merciful God, grant that the old
Adam in <b>this child</b> may be so buried,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">{275}</a></span>
that the new man may be raised up in
<b>him</b>.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>Grant that all carnal affections may
die in <b>him</b>, and that all things belonging
to the Spirit may live and grow in
<b>him</b>.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>Grant that <b>he</b> may have power and
strength to have victory, and to triumph
against the devil, the world, and
the flesh.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>Grant that whosoever is dedicated
to thee by our office and ministry may
also be endued with heavenly virtues,
and everlastingly rewarded through
thy mercy, O blessed Lord God, who
dost live and govern all things, world
without end.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>Almighty, ever-living God, whose
most dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ,
for the forgiveness of our sins did shed
out of his most precious side both
water and blood, and gave commandment
to his disciples that they
should go teach all nations, and baptize
them in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
regard, we beseech thee, the supplications
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">{276}</a></span>
of thy congregation; and grant
that <b>this child</b>, now to be baptized, may
receive the fullness of thy grace, and
ever remain in the number of thy
faithful and elect children, through Jesus
Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall the people stand up, and the minister shall say:</p>

<p>Hear the words of the Gospel written by St. Mark
in the tenth chapter, at the thirteenth
verse.</p>

<p>They brought young children to
Christ, that he should touch them. And
his disciples rebuked those that
brought them; but when Jesus saw it,
he was much displeased, and said unto
them, Suffer the little children to come
unto me, and forbid them not, for of
such is the kingdom of God. Verily I
say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive
the kingdom of God as a little
child, he shall not enter therein. And
he took them up in his arms, put his
hands upon them, and blessed them.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then the minister, addressing the parents or others presenting the
child, shall say:+</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">{277}</a></span>
In causing <b>this child</b> to be brought
by baptism into the Church of Christ,
it is your duty to teach <b>him</b> to renounce
the devil and all his works, the
vain pomp and glory of the world,
with all covetous desires of the same,
and the carnal desires of the flesh, so
that <b>he</b> may not follow or be led by
them; to believe all the articles of the
Christian faith; and to obediently keep
God's holy will and commandments
all the days of <b>his</b> life.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then the minister shall take the child into his hands, if convenient,
and say to the friends of the child:+</p>

<p>NAME THIS CHILD</p>

<p>N., I baptize thee in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">The minister may, at his discretion, lay
hands on the subject, accompanying the
act with a suitable invocation, and then,
all kneeling, close with extemporaneous
devotions and the Lord's Prayer:</p>

<p>Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">{278}</a></span>
be thy name; thy kingdom
come; thy will be done on earth, as it
is heaven; give us this day our daily
bread; and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against
us; and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER LI.<br />
 <small>THE MINISTRATION OF BAPTISM TO SUCH AS ARE OF RIPER YEARS.</small></h3>

<p class="ritual">The minister, coming to the font, which is to be filled with pure
water, shall use the following, or some other suitable exhortation:</p>

<p>Dearly beloved, forasmuch as all
men are conceived and born in sin,
(and that which is born of the flesh is
flesh, and they that are in the flesh cannot
please God, but live in sin, committing
many actual transgressions,)
and that our Saviour Christ saith, Except
a man be born of water and of the
Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">{279}</a></span>
of God; I beseech you to call upon
God the Father, through our Lord Jesus
Christ, that of his bounteous goodness
he will grant to <b>these persons</b> that
which by nature <b>they</b> cannot have:
that <b>they</b> may be baptized with water
and the Holy Ghost, and received into
Christ's holy Church, and be made
lively <b>members</b> of the same.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall the minister say:</p>

<p>Almighty and immortal God, the aid
of all that need, the helper of all that
flee to thee for succor, the life of them
that believe, and the resurrection of
the dead: we call upon thee for <b>these
persons</b> now to be baptized. Receive
<b>them</b>, O Lord, as thou hast promised
by thy well-beloved Son, saying, Ask,
and ye shall receive; seek, and ye shall
find; knock, and it shall be opened
unto you: so give now unto us that
ask; let us that seek find; open the
gate unto us that knock; that <b>these
persons</b> may enjoy the everlasting
benediction of thy heavenly washing,
and may come to the eternal kingdom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">{280}</a></span>
which thou hast promised by Christ
our Lord.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall the people stand up, and the minister shall say:</p>

<p>Hear the words of the Gospel, written by
St. John in the third chapter, beginning
at the first verse.</p>

<p>There was a man of the Pharisees,
named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
The same came to Jesus by night, and
said unto him, Rabbi, we know that
thou art a teacher come from God; for
no man can do these miracles that thou
doest, except God be with him. Jesus
answered and said unto him, Verily,
verily, I say unto thee, Except a man
be born again he cannot see the kingdom
of God. Nicodemus saith unto
him, How can a man be born when he
is old? Can he enter the second time
into his mother's womb, and be born?
Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say
unto thee, Except a man be born of
water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter
into the kingdom of God. That
which is born of the flesh is flesh; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span>
that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
Marvel not that I said unto thee,
Ye must be born again. The wind
bloweth where it listeth, and thou
hearest the sound thereof, but canst
not tell whence it cometh, and whither
it goeth; so is every one that is born
of the Spirit.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then the minister shall speak to the persons to be baptized on this
wise:</p>

<p>Well-beloved, who are come hither,
desiring to receive holy baptism, <b>ye
have</b> heard how the congregation hath
prayed that our Lord Jesus Christ,
would vouchsafe to receive <b>you</b>, and
bless <b>you</b>, to release <b>you</b> of your sins,
to give <b>you</b> the kingdom of heaven,
and everlasting life. And our Lord
Jesus Christ hath promised in his holy
word to grant all those things that we
have prayed for; which promise he for
his part will most surely keep and perform.</p>

<p>Wherefore after this promise made
by Christ, <b>ye</b> must also faithfully, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">{282}</a></span>
<b>your</b> part, promise, in the presence of
this whole congregation, that <b>ye</b> will
renounce the devil and all his works,
and constantly believe God's holy
word, and obediently keep his commandments.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall the minister demand of each of
the persons to be baptized, severally:</p>

<p>Ques. Doth thou renounce the devil
and all his works, the vain pomp and
glory of the world, with all covetous
desires of the same, and the carnal desires
of the flesh, so that thou wilt not
follow or be led by them?</p>

<p>Ans. I renounce them all.</p>

<p>Ques. Dost thou believe in God the
Father Almighty, maker of heaven and
earth? and in Jesus Christ, his only
begotten Son, our Lord? and that he
was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born
of the Virgin Mary? that he suffered
under Pontius Pilate, was crucified,
dead, and buried? that he rose again
the third day? that he ascended into
heaven, and sitteth at the right hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">{283}</a></span>
of God the Father Almighty, and from
thence shall come again at the end of
the world, to judge the quick and the
dead?</p>

<p>And dost thou believe in the Holy
Ghost, the Church of God, the communion
of saints, the remission of sins,
the resurrection of the body, and everlasting
life after death?</p>

<p>Ans. All this I steadfastly believe.</p>

<p>Ques. Wilt thou be baptized in this
faith?</p>

<p>Ans. This is my desire.</p>

<p>Ques. Wilt thou then obediently
keep God's holy will and commandments,
and walk in the same all the
days of thy life?</p>

<p>Ans. I will endeavor so to do, God
being my helper.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall the minister say:</p>

<p>O merciful God, grant that the old
Adam in <b>these</b> persons may be so buried,
that the new man may be raised
up in <b>them</b>.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>Grant that all carnal affections may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">{284}</a></span>
die in <b>them</b>, and that all things belonging
to the Spirit may live and grow in
<b>them</b>.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>Grant that <b>they</b> may have power
and strength to have victory, and to
triumph against the devil, the world,
and the flesh.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>Grant that <b>they</b>, being here dedicated
to thee by our office and ministry,
may also be endued with heavenly virtues,
and everlastingly rewarded,
through thy mercy, O blessed Lord
God, who dost live and govern all
things, world without end.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>Almighty, ever-living God, whose
most dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ
for the forgiveness of our sins, did
shed out of his most precious side both
water and blood; and gave commandment
to his disciples, that they should
go teach all nations, and baptize them
in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost: regard,
we beseech thee, the supplications of
this congregation; and grant that the
<b>persons</b> now to be baptized may receive
the fullness of thy grace, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">{285}</a></span>
ever remain in the number of thy
faithful and elect children, through
Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall the minister take each person to be baptized by the right
hand; and placing him conveniently by the font, according to his
discretion, shall ask the name; and then shall sprinkle or pour water
upon him, (or, if he shall desire it, shall immerse him in water),
saying:</p>

<p>N., I baptize thee in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">The minister may, at his discretion, lay
hands on the subject, accompanying the
act with a suitable invocation.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER LII.<br />
 <small>FORM OF THE RECEPTION AND RECOGNITION OF CHURCH MEMBERS.</small></h3>

<p class="ritual">The minister shall cause the candidates to
be placed before the congregation, and
after baptizing any who may not have
been previously baptized he shall say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">{286}</a></span>
Brethren, the Church is of God, and
will be preserved to the end of time,
for the promotion of his worship and
the due administration of his word and
ordinances—the maintenance of Christian
fellowship and discipline—the edification
of believers, and the conversion
of the world. All, of every age
and station, stand in need of the
means of grace which it alone supplies;
and it invites all alike to become
fellow-citizens with the saints
and of the household of God. But as
none who have arrived at years of
discretion can remain within its pales
or be admitted to its communion,
without assuming its obligations, it is
my duty to demand of these persons
present whether they are resolved to
assume the same.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall the minister address the candidates, as follows:</p>

<p>Dearly beloved, you profess to have
a desire to flee from the wrath to come
and to be saved from your sins; you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">{287}</a></span>
seek the fellowship of the people of
God, to assist you in working out your
salvation; I therefore demand of you:</p>

<p>Do you solemnly, in the presence of
God and this congregation, ratify and
confirm the promise and vow of repentance,
faith, and obedience, contained
in the baptismal convent?</p>

<p>Ans. I do, God being my helper.</p>

<p>Will you be subject to the discipline
of the Church, attend upon its ordinances,
and support its institutions?</p>

<p>Ans. I will endeavor so to do, by
the help of God.</p>

<p class="ritual">The minister shall then say to the candidates:</p>

<p>We rejoice to recognize you as members
of the Church of Christ, and bid
you welcome to all its privileges; and
in token of our brotherly love, we give
you the right hand of fellowship, and
pray that you may be both numbered
with his people here, and with his
saints in glory everlasting.</p>

<p class="ritual">The minister shall then say to the congregation:</p>

<p>Brethren, I commend to your love
and care these persons whom we this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">{288}</a></span>
day recognize as members of the
Church of Christ. Do all in your power
to increase their faith, confirm their
hope, and perfect them in love.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then may follow a hymn suitable to the
occasion (as 881-889), and the minister
shall say:</p>

<p>Let us pray.</p>

<p>Almighty God, we thank thee for
founding thy Church, and promising
that the gates of hell shall not prevail
against it. We bless thee for calling
us to the fellowship of thy people, and
for numbering us with the sons and
daughters of the Lord Almighty. We
especially praise thy name for enabling
these thy servants to avouch the
Lord to be their God. Help them to
perform the promise and vow which
they have made; to renounce the devil,
the world, and the flesh; to believe the
record which thou hast given of thy
Son; and to walk in all thy commandments
and ordinances blameless, to the
end of their lives. May their communion
with thy people be sanctified
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">{289}</a></span>
to their growth in grace and in the
knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ, being nourished and knit
together, increasing with the increase
of God. May thy people do them good,
and may they prove a blessing to thy
people. And grant, O Lord, that all
who are here members of thy militant
Church, through thy mercy, the merit
of thy Son, and the grace of thy Spirit,
may finally be made members of
thy triumphant Church in heaven.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>Almighty and everlasting God,
Heavenly Father, we give thee humble
thanks, for that thou hast vouchsafed
to call us to the knowledge of thy
grace, and faith in thee; increase this
knowledge and confirm this faith in us
evermore. Give thy Holy Spirit to
these persons, that they, being born
again, may be made heirs of everlasting
salvation, through our Lord Jesus
Christ, who liveth and reigneth with
thee and the Holy Spirit, now and forever.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">{290}</a></span>
be thy name; thy kingdom
come; thy will be done on earth as it
is in heaven; give us this day our
daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass
against us; and lead us not into
temptation, but deliver us from evil.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER LIII.<br />
 <small>THE FORM OF SOLEMNIZATION OF MATRIMONY.</small></h3>

<p class="ritual">At the day and time appointed for the solemnization of matrimony, the
persons to be married (having been qualified according to law) standing
together, the man on the right hand and the woman on the left, the
minister shall say:</p>

<p>Dearly beloved, we are gathered together
here in the sight of God, and
in the presence of these witnesses, to
join together this man and this woman
in holy matrimony; which is an
honorable estate, instituted of God in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">{291}</a></span>
the time of man's innocency, signifying
unto us the mystical union that is
between Christ and his Church; which
holy estate Christ adorned and beautified
with his presence, and first miracle
that he wrought in Cana of Galilee,
and is commended of St. Paul to
be honorable among all men; and
therefore is not by any to be enterprised,
or taken in hand unadvisedly,
but reverently, discreetly, advisedly,
and in the fear of God.</p>

<p>Into which holy estate these two
persons present come now to be joined.
Therefore if any can show any just
cause why they may not lawfully be
joined together, let him now speak, or
else hereafter forever hold his peace.</p>

<p class="ritual">And also speaking unto the persons that are
to be married, he shall say:</p>

<p>I require and charge you both, (as
ye will answer at the dreadful day of
judgment, when the secrets of all
hearts shall be disclosed) that if either
of you know any impediment why ye
may not be lawfully joined together in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">{292}</a></span>
matrimony, ye do now confess it; for
be ye well assured, that so many as
are coupled together otherwise than
God's word doth allow, are not joined
together by God, neither is their matrimony
lawful.</p>

<p class="ritual">If no impediment be alleged, then shall the
minister say unto the man:</p>

<p>M., Wilt thou have this woman to
be thy wedded wife, to live together
after God's ordinance, in the holy estate
of matrimony? Wilt thou love
her, comfort her, honor, and keep her,
in sickness and in health; and, forsaking
all other, keep thee only unto
her, so long as ye both shall live?</p>

<p class="ritual">The man shall answer,</p>

<p>I WILL.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall the minister say unto the woman:</p>

<p>N., Wilt thou have this man to be
thy wedded husband, to live together
after God's ordinance, in the holy estate
of matrimony? Wilt thou obey
him, serve him, love, honor, and keep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">{293}</a></span>
him, in sickness and in health; and,
forsaking all other, keep thee only
unto him, so long as ye both shall live?</p>

<p class="ritual">The woman shall answer,</p>

<p>I WILL.</p>

<p class="ritual">When the parties so desire, the man shall
give unto the woman a ring; and the minister
taking the ring shall deliver it unto
the man to put it upon the fourth finger
of the woman's left hand; and the man,
holding the ring there, and taught by the
minister, shall say:</p>

<p>With this ring I thee wed, and with
all my worldly goods I thee endow; in
the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall the minister say:</p>

<p>Let us pray.</p>

<p>Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed
be thy name; thy kingdom
come; thy will be done on earth, as it
is in heaven; give us this day our daily
bread; and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">{294}</a></span>
us; and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil; for
thine is the kingdom and the power,
and the glory, forever and ever.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>O eternal God, Creator and Preserver
of all mankind, Giver of all spiritual
grace, the Author of everlasting
life, send thy blessing upon these thy
servants, this man and this woman,
whom we bless in thy name; that as
Isaac and Rebecca lived faithfully together,
so these persons may surely
perform and keep the vow and covenant
between them made, and may ever
remain in perfect love and peace together
and live according to thy laws,
through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall the minister join their right
hands together, and say:</p>

<p>Those whom God hath joined together,
let no man put asunder.</p>

<p>Forasmuch as M. and N. have consented
together in holy wedlock, and
have witnessed the same before God
and this company, and thereto have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">{295}</a></span>
pledged their faith either to other, and
have declared the same by joining
hands, I pronounce that they are man
and wife together, in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">And the minister shall add this blessing:</p>

<p>God the Father, God the Son, God
the Holy Ghost, bless, preserve, and
keep you; the Lord mercifully with
his favor look upon you; and so fill
you with all spiritual benediction and
grace, that ye may so live together in
this life, that in the world to come ye
may have life everlasting.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER LIV.<br />
 <small>THE ORDER OF THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD</small></h3>

<p class="ritual">The minister meeting the corpse, and going
before it, shall say:</p>

<p>I am the resurrection and the life;
he that believeth in me, though he
were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">{296}</a></span>
liveth, and believeth in me, shall
never die.—John xi. 25, 26.</p>

<p>I know that my Redeemer liveth,
and that he shall stand at the latter
day upon the earth; and though after
my skin worms destroy this body, yet
in my flesh shall I see God; whom I
shall see for myself, and mine eyes
shall behold, and not another.—Job.
xix. 25-27.</p>

<p>We brought nothing into this world,
and it is certain we can carry nothing
out. The Lord gave, and the Lord
hath taken away; blessed be the name
of the Lord.—1 Tim. vi. 7; Job. i. 21.</p>

<p class="ritual">After they are come into the church or home
shall be read Psalm xc.</p>

<p>Lord, thou hast been our dwelling
place in all generations.</p>

<p>Before the mountains were brought
forth, or ever thou hadst formed the
earth and the world, even from everlasting
to everlasting, thou art God.</p>

<p>Thou turnest man to destruction;
and sayest, Return, ye children of
men.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">{297}</a></span></p>

<p>For a thousand years in thy sight
are but as yesterday when it is past,
and as a watch in the night.</p>

<p>Thou carriest them away as with a
flood: they are as a sleep; in the morning
they are like grass which groweth
up.</p>

<p>In the morning it flourisheth, and
groweth up; in the evening it is cut
down, and withereth.</p>

<p>For we are consumed by thine anger,
and by thy wrath are we troubled.</p>

<p>Thou hast set our iniquities before
thee, our secret sins in the light of
thy countenance.</p>

<p>For all our days are passed away in
thy wrath: we spend our years as a
tale that is told.</p>

<p>The days of our years are threescore
years and ten; and if by reason
of strength they be fourscore years,
yet is their strength labor and sorrow;
for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.</p>

<p>Who knoweth the power of thine
anger? even according to thy fear, so
is thy wrath.</p>

<p>So teach us to number our days,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">{298}</a></span>
that we may apply our hearts unto
wisdom.</p>

<p>Return, O Lord, how long? and let
it repent thee concerning thy servants.</p>

<p>O satisfy us early with thy mercy;
that we may rejoice and be glad all
our days.</p>

<p>Make us glad according to the days
wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the
years wherein we have seen evil.</p>

<p>Let thy work appear unto thy servants,
and thy glory unto their children.</p>

<p>And let the beauty of the Lord our
God be upon us; and establish thou
the work of our hands upon us; yea,
the work of our hands establish thou
it.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall follow the Lesson, 1 Cor. xv. 20-58,
or the following abridgement:</p>

<p>Now is Christ risen from the dead,
and become the first fruits of them
that slept. For since by man came
death, by man came also the resurrection
of the dead. For as in Adam all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">{299}</a></span>
die, even so in Christ shall all be made
alive. But every man in his own order:
Christ the first-fruits; afterward
they that are Christ's at his coming.
Then cometh the end, when he
shall have delivered up the kingdom
to God, even the Father; when he
shall have put down all rule, and all
authority, and power. For he must
reign, till he hath put all enemies under
his feet. The last enemy that
shall be destroyed is death. For he
hath put all things under his feet—But
some man will say, How are the
dead raised up? and with what body
do they come? Thou fool, that which
thou sowest is not quickened except
it die: and that which thou sowest,
thou sowest not that body that shall
be, but bare grain; it may chance of
wheat, or of some other grain; but
God giveth it a body as it hath pleased
him, and to every seed his own
body. All flesh is not the same flesh;
but there is one kind of flesh of men,
another flesh of beasts, another of fishes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">{300}</a></span>
and another of birds. There are
also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial;
but the glory of the terrestrial is
one and the glory of the celestial is
another. There is one glory of the
sun, and another glory of the moon,
and another glory of the stars; for one
star differeth from another star in
glory. So also is the resurrection of
the dead. It is sown in corruption, it
is raised in incorruption; it is sown in
dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is
sown in weakness, it is raised in power;
it is sown a natural body, it is
raised a spiritual body.—Behold, I
show you a mystery: We shall not
all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
in a moment, in the twinkling of an
eye, at the last trump; for the
trumpet shall sound, and the dead
shall be raised incorruptible, and we
shall be changed. For this corruptible
must put on incorruption, and
this mortal must put on immortality.
So when this corruptible shall have
put on incorruption, and this mortal
shall have put on immortality, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">{301}</a></span>
shall be brought to pass the saying
that is written, Death is swallowed
up in victory. O death, where is thy
sting? O grave, where is thy victory?
The sting of death is sin; and the
strength of sin is the law. But thanks
be to God, which giveth us the victory,
through our Lord Jesus Christ.
Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye
steadfast, unmovable, always abounding
in the work of the Lord, forasmuch
as ye know that your labor is
not in vain in the Lord.</p>

<p class="ritual">Here may follow a suitable hymn, a sermon
or exhortation, and an extemporary prayer.</p>

<p class="ritual">At the grave, when the corpse is laid in the
earth, the minister shall say:</p>

<p>Man that is born of a woman is of
few days, and full of trouble. He
cometh forth like a flower, and is cut
down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and
continueth not.</p>

<p>In the midst of life we are in death:
of whom may we seek for succor, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">{302}</a></span>
of thee, O Lord, who for our sins art
justly displeased?</p>

<p>Yet, O Lord God most holy, O Lord
most mighty, O holy and most merciful
Saviour, deliver us not into the
bitter pains of eternal death.</p>

<p>Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of
our hearts: shut not thy merciful ears
to our prayers, but spare us, O holy
and merciful Saviour, thou most worthy
Judge eternal, suffer us not at
our last hour for any pains of death
to fall from thee.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then the minister may say:</p>

<p>Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty
God, in his wise providence,
to take out of this world the soul of
our deceased <b>brother</b>, we therefore
commit <b>his</b> body to the ground, earth
to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust;
looking for the general resurrection
in the last day, and the life of the
world to come, through our Lord Jesus
Christ; at whose second coming in
glorious majesty to judge the world,
the earth and the sea shall give up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">{303}</a></span>
their dead; and the corruptible bodies
of those who sleep in him shall be
changed, and made like unto his own
glorious body, according to the mighty
working whereby he is able to subdue
all things unto himself.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall be said:</p>

<p>I heard a voice from heaven, saying
unto me, Write, Blessed are the
dead which die in the Lord from henceforth:
Yea, saith the Spirit, that they
may rest from their labors.</p>

<p class="ritual">A suitable hymn may here be sung; and then shall the minister say:</p>

<p>Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed
be thy name; thy kingdom

<p>O merciful God, the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, who is the resurrection
and the life; in whom whosoever
believeth shall live, though he die; and
whosoever liveth and believeth in him,
shall not die eternally: we meekly beseech
thee, O Father, to raise us from
the death of sin unto the life of righteousness;
that when we shall depart
this life we may rest in him and at the
general resurrection on the last day
may be found acceptable in thy sight,

 <h3>CHAPTER LV.<br />
 <small>FORM OF LAYING THE CORNER STONE OF A CHURCH</small></h3>

<p class="ritual">At the time and place of laying the corner
stone, let the minister cause a suitable
hymn to be sung (e. g. 780, 781, or 782).
Then shall the minister say:</p>

<p>Let us pray.</p>

<p>Almighty and everlasting God, thou
art infinite in all thy perfections, and
marvelous in all thy works. Thou hast
made the world and all things therein;
and seeing that thou art Lord of heaven
and earth, thou dwellest not in
temples made with hands; thou art a
Spirit, and art worshiped in spirit and
in truth, in all places of thy dominion;
yet we thank thee that thou dost allow
us to build houses for thy services,
wherein thy people may attend
upon thee without distraction. We
bless thy holy name for putting it into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">{306}</a></span>
the hearts of thy people to build a
house, at this place, for thy worship.
We beseech thee to inspire us with
zeal, that we may both have a mind to
the work, and may successfully accomplish
the same. May neither adversary
nor evil occurent hinder this work;
but may the good hand of our God be
upon us, that in due time we may bring
forth the headstone with joy and
praise. May this sanctuary, when
completed, long remain a house of
prayer for all people, where incense
shall be offered unto thy name, and a
pure offering, and thy word and ordinances
by the influences of the Holy
Ghost. Here may multitudes be born
again, and be nurtured in knowledge
and piety; so that they may be prepared,
in the kingdom of thy glory.
We are unworthy, O Lord, through our
manifold sins, to offer unto thee any
sacrifice; yet we beseech thee to accept
this our bounden duty and service,
not weighing our merits, but pardoning
our offenses, through Jesus
Christ our Lord: by whom and with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">{307}</a></span>
whom, in the unity of the Holy Ghost
all honor and glory be unto thee, Father
Almighty, world without end.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings,
with thy most gracious favor,
and further us with thy continual
help; that in all our works, begun,
continued, and ended in thee, we may
glorify thy holy name, and finally, by
thy mercy, obtain everlasting life,
through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed
be thy name, thy kingdom
come; thy will be done on earth, as it
is in heaven; give us this day our daily
bread; and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against
us; and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then, shall the minister read, or cause to be
read, the following sentences:</p>

<p>Blessed be thou, Lord God of Israel
our Father, forever and ever.</p>

<p>Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and
the power, and the glory, and the victory,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">{308}</a></span>
and the majesty; for all that is
in the heaven and in the earth is thine;
thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and
thou art exalted as head above all.</p>

<p>Both riches and honor come of thee,
and thou reignest over all; and in
thine hand is power and might; and
in thine hand it is to make great, and
to give strength unto all.</p>

<p>Now, therefore, our God, we thank
thee, and praise thy glorious name.</p>

<p>But who am I, and what is my people,
that we should be able to offer so
willingly after this sort? for all things
come of thee, and of thine own have
we given thee.</p>

<p>For we are strangers before thee,
and sojourners, as were all our fathers;
our days on the earth are as a
shadow, and there is none abiding.</p>

<p>O Lord our God, all this store that
we have prepared to build thee a
house for thine holy name cometh of
thine hand, and is all thine own.</p>

<p>I know also, my God, that thou triest
the heart, and has pleasure in uprightness.
As for me, in the uprightness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">{309}</a></span>
of mine heart I have willingly offered
all these things; and now have
I seen with joy thy people, which are
present here, to offer willingly unto
thee.</p>

<p>Except the Lord build the house,
they labor in vain that build it; except
the Lord keep the city, the watchman
waketh but in vain.</p>

<p>Let thy work appear unto thy servants,
and the glory unto their children.</p>

<p>And let the beauty of the Lord our
God be upon us; and establish thou
the work of our hands upon us; yea,
the work of our hands establish thou
it.</p>

<p>His foundation is in the holy mountains.</p>

<p>The Lord loveth the gates of Zion
more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
For the Lord hath chosen Zion; he
hath desired it for his habitation.</p>

<p>This is my rest forever: here will I
dwell: for I have desired it.</p>

<p>I will abundantly bless her provision:
I will satisfy her poor with bread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">{310}</a></span>
I will also clothe her priests with
salvation, and her saints shall shout
aloud for joy.</p>

<p>The stone which the builders refused
is become the head-stone of the corner.</p>

<p>This is the Lord's doing; it is marvelous
in our eyes.</p>

<p>For other foundation can no man
lay than is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall the minister, standing by the
stone, announce the articles to be deposited
therein. These may be a copy of
the Bible, the Hymn Book, the Discipline,
Church periodicals, a document setting
forth the name of the Church, with the
names of the pastor, trustees, and building
committee, and such other articles as
may be desired. The stone shall be laid
by the minister, or some one appointed by
him; and placing his hand upon the stone,
the minister shall say:</p>

<p>We lay this corner stone of a house
to be built and set apart, from all
worldly uses, for divine worship, in
the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then may follow an address, the collection
(if any) the Doxology, and Benediction.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">{311}</a></div>

 <h3>CHAPTER LVI.<br />
 <small>FORM OF THE DEDICATION OF A CHURCH</small></h3>

<p class="ritual">Let the service be conducted as on the other
occasions of public worship—only the
hymns (e. g. 783-780,) prayer, lesson, and
sermons, should be adapted to the occasion.
The lessons may be Gen. xxviii.
10-22, and Heb. x. 19-25, or any other at
the discretion of the minister.</p>

<p class="center">FIRST LESSON. GEN. xxviii. 10-22.</p>

<p>And Jacob went out from Beersheba,
and went toward Haran. And he lighted
upon a certain place, and tarried
there all night, because the sun was
set; and he took of the stones of that
place, and put them for his pillows,
and lay down in that place to sleep.
And he dreamed, and behold, a ladder
set up on the earth, and the top of it
reached to heaven; and behold, the angels
of God ascending and descending
on it. And behold, the Lord stood above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">{312}</a></span>
it, and said, I am the Lord God of
Abraham thy father, and the God of
Isaac; the land whereon thou liest, to
thee will I give it, and to thy seed.
And thy seed shall be as the dust of
the earth; and thou shalt spread abroad
to the west, and to the east, and
to the north, and to the south; and in
thee and in thy seed shall all the families
of the earth be blessed. And behold,
I am with thee, and will keep
thee in all places whither thou goest,
and will bring thee again into this
land; for I will not leave thee, until
I have done that which I have spoken
to thee of. And Jacob, awaked out of
his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord
is in this place; and I knew it not.
And he was afraid, and said, How
dreadful is this place! this is none
other but the house of God, and this is
the gate of heaven. And Jacob rose
up early in the morning, and took the
stone that he had put for his pillows,
and set it up for a pillar, and poured
oil upon the top of it. And he called
the name of that place Bethel; but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">{313}</a></span>
name of that city was called Luz at
the first. And Jacob vowed a vow,
saying, If God will be with me, and
will keep me in this way that I go, and
will give me bread to eat, and raiment
to put on, so that I come again to
my father's house in peace; then shall
the Lord be my God: and this stone,
which I have set for a pillar, shall be
God's house; and of all that thou shalt
give me I will surely give the tenth
unto thee.</p>

<p class="center">SECOND LESSON. HEB. x. 19-25.</p>

<p>Having therefore, brethren, boldness
to enter into the holiest by the blood
of Jesus, by a new and living way,
which he hath consecrated for us,
through the vail, that is to say, his
flesh; having an high-priest over the
house of God; let us draw near with
a true heart, in full assurance of faith,
having our hearts sprinkled from an
evil conscience, and our bodies washed
with pure water. Let us hold
fast to the profession of our faith
without wavering: for he is faithful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">{314}</a></span>
that promised: and let us consider one
another, to provoke unto love, and to
good works; not forsaking the assembling
of ourselves together, as the
manner of some is; but exhorting one
another; and so much the more, as ye
see the day approaching.</p>

<p class="ritual">The Collection (if any) may follow the sermon.
The officers of the Church shall then
address the minister in the following language:</p>

<p>We present to you this house, to be
set apart from all unhallowed or common
uses, for the worship of Almighty
God.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall the minister request the congregation
to stand, while he pronounces the
following Sentence of Dedication:</p>

<p class="center">SENTENCE OF DEDICATION</p>

<p>Forasmuch as God has put it into
the hearts of his people to build this
house for his worship, and has blessed
them in their undertaking, we solemnly
dedicate it to his service, for the
reading and expounding of his holy
word, the administration of his ordinances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">{315}</a></span>
and for all other acts of religious
worship. That he may graciously
accept this labor of our hands, let us
devoutly pray.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall be said, all kneeling:</p>

<p>Almighty and everlasting God, the
heaven, and the heaven of heavens,
cannot contain thee, much less this
house which we have built; yet thou
dost humble thyself to behold the inhabitants
of the earth, and dost promise
that in all places where thou dost
record thy name thou wilt meet with
thy people, and bless them. Let thy
name be recorded in this place, and
here let thine honor dwell. Preserve
this house, which we set apart to thy
service, from injury and desecration.
Accept the worship which shall be here
offered to thy name. Let thy Holy
Spirit accompany thy word and ordinances,
which shall be here administered,
so that they may prove means
of grace to all who shall receive the
same. May many sons and daughters
be here born to the Lord Almighty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">{316}</a></span>
Let thy people be abundantly satisfied
with the fatness of thy house, and
make them drink of the river of thy
pleasures. Let their children be here
fed with food convenient for them, and
be brought up in the nurture and admonition
of the Lord. Let living waters
go forth from this sanctuary, carrying
life and joy to all around. Let
thy work appear unto thy servants,
and thy glory unto their children, and
let the beauty of the Lord our God be
upon us; and establish thou the work
of our hands upon us, yea the work
of our hands establish thou it. Now,
therefore arise, O Lord God, into thy
resting place, thou and the ark of thy
strength; let thy ministers be clothed
with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice
in goodness. We beseech thee, O
Lord, to overlook our unworthiness,
forgive our sins, and make us a habitation
of God through the Spirit. We
offer all our offerings through the ever-blessed
name of our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ, to whom, with thee, and
the Holy Spirit, be glory and majesty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">{317}</a></span>
dominion and power, both now and
ever.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">The service may then be concluded with the
Doxology and Benediction.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER LI.<br />
 <small>THE FORM AND MANNER OF ORDAINING  DEACONS</small></h3>

<p class="ritual">When the day appointed by the Bishop is
come, after a suitable sermon or exhortation,
one of the Elders shall present unto
the Bishop all them that are to be ordained,
and say:</p>

<p>I present unto you these persons
present, to be ordained Deacons.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then their names being read aloud, the Bishop
shall say unto the people:</p>

<p>Brethren, if there be any of you
who knoweth any impediment or crime
in any of these persons presented to
be ordained Deacons; for the which
he ought not to be admitted to that
office, let him come forth in the name
of God and show what the crime or
impediment is.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">{318}</a></div>

<p class="ritual">If any crime or impediment be objected, the
Bishop shall surcease from ordaining that
person unto such time as the party accused
shall be found clear of that crime.
Then shall be read the following collect.</p>

<p class="center">THE COLLECT.</p>

<p>Almighty God, who by thy divine
providence hast appointed divers orders
of ministers in thy Church, and
didst inspire thy apostles to choose into
the order of Deacons thy first martyr,
St. Stephen, with others: mercifully
behold these thy servants, now
called to the like office and administration;
replenish them so with the truth
of thy doctrine, and adorn them with
innocency of life, that both by word
and good example they may faithfully
serve thee in this office, to the glory
of thy name, and the edification of thy
Church, through the merits of our Saviour
Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth
with thee and the Holy Ghost, now
and forever.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then the Bishop or one of the Elders appointed
by him, shall read the Epistle.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">{319}</a></div>

<p class="center">THE EPISTLE. 1 TIM. iii. 8-13.</p>

<p>Likewise must the Deacons be grave,
not double tongued, not given to much
wine, not greedy of filthy lucre: holding
the mystery of the faith in a pure
conscience. And let these also first be
proved; then let them use the office of
a Deacon, being found blameless. Even
so must their wives be grave, not
slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.
Let the Deacons be the husbands of
one wife, ruling their children and
their own houses well. For they that
have used the office of a Deacon well,
purchase to themselves a good degree,
and great boldness in the faith which
is in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall the Bishop examine every one of
those who are to be ordained, in the press
of the people, after this manner following:</p>

<p>Do you trust that you are inwardly
moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon
you the office of the ministry in the
Church of Christ, to serve God for the
promoting of his glory and the edifying
of his people?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">{320}</a></span>
Ans. I trust so.</p>

<p>The Bishop. Do you unfeignedly
believe all the canonical Scriptures of
the Old and New Testament.</p>

<p>Ans. I do believe them.</p>

<p>The Bishop. Will you diligently
read or expound the same unto the people
whom you shall be appointed to
serve?</p>

<p>Ans. I will.</p>

<p>The Bishop. It appertaineth to the
office of a Deacon to assist the Elder
in Divine service, and especially when
he ministereth the holy communion, to
help him in the distribution thereof,
and to read and expound the Holy
Scriptures: to instruct the youth; and
in the absence of the Elder to baptize.</p>

<p>And, furthermore, it is his office to
search for the sick, poor, and impotent,
that they may be visited and relieved.</p>

<p>Will you do this gladly and willingly?</p>

<p>Ans. I will do so, by the help of
God.</p>

<p>The Bishop. Will you apply all
your diligence to frame and fashion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">{321}</a></span>
your own lives (and the lives of your
families) according to the doctrine of
Christ; and to make both yourselves,
and them, as much as in you lieth,
wholesome examples of the flock of
Christ?</p>

<p>Ans. I will do so, the Lord being
my helper.</p>

<p>The Bishop. Will you reverently
obey them to whom the charge and
government over you is committed,
following with a glad mind and will
their godly admonitions?</p>

<p>Ans. I will endeavor so to do, the
Lord being my helper.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then the Bishop, laying his hands severally
upon the head of every one of them, shall
say:</p>

<p>Take thou authority to execute the
office of a Deacon in the Church of
God; in the name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall the Bishop deliver to every one
of them the Holy Bible, saying:</p>

<p>Take thou authority to read the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">{322}</a></span>
Holy Scriptures in the Church of God,
and to preach the same.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then one of them appointed by the Bishop
shall read the Gospel.</p>

<p class="center">THE GOSPEL. LUKE xii. 35-38.</p>

<p>Let your loins be girded about, and
your lights burning, and ye yourselves
like unto men that wait for their Lord,
when he will return from the wedding,
that when he cometh and knocketh,
they may open unto him immediately.
Blessed are those servants whom the
lord when he cometh shall find watching.
Verily I say unto you, that he
shall gird himself and make them to
sit down to meat, and will come forth
and serve them. And if he shall come
in the second watch, or come in the
third watch, and find them so, blessed
are those servants.</p>

<p class="ritual">Immediately before the benediction shall be
said these Collects following:</p>

<p>Almighty God, giver of all good
things, who of thy great goodness hast
vouchsafed to accept and take these
thy servants into the office of Deacons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">{323}</a></span>
in thy Church: make them, we beseech
thee, O Lord, to be modest, humble,
and constant in their ministration, and
to have a ready will to observe all
spiritual discipline; that they having
always the testimony of a good conscience,
and continuing ever stable and
strong in thy Son Christ, may so well
behave themselves in this inferior office,
that they may be found worthy to
be called unto the higher ministries in
thy Church, through the same thy Son
our Saviour Jesus Christ; to whom be
glory and honor, world without end.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings,
with thy most gracious favor, and
further us with thy continual help;
that in all our works, begun, continued,
and ended in thee, we may glorify
thy holy name, and finally, by thy
mercy, obtain everlasting life, through
Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="center">The Benediction</p>

minds in the knowledge and love of
God, and of his Son Jesus Christ, our

 <h3>CHAPTER LVIII.<br />

<p class="ritual">When the day appointed by the Bishop is
come there shall be a sermon or exhortation,
declaring the duty and office of such

that order is in the Church of

Elders. For after due examination,
we find not to the contrary, but
that they are lawfully called to this
function and ministry, and that they
are persons meet for the same. But if
there be any of you who know any
impediment or crime in any of them,
for the which he ought not to be received
into this holy ministry, let him
come forth in the name of God, and
show what the crime or impediment is.</p>

<p class="ritual">If any crime or impediment be objected, the
Bishop shall surcease from ordaining that

(Now that he ascended, what is it but
that he also descended first into the
lower parts of the earth? He that descended
is the same also that ascended
up far above all heavens, that he might

way, the same is a thief and a robber.
But he that entereth in by the door, is
the shepherd of the sheep. To him the
porter openeth; and the sheep hear his
voice; and he calleth his own sheep by
name, and leadeth them out. And
when he putteth forth his own sheep,
he goeth before them, and the sheep
follow him: for they know his voice.
And a stranger will they not follow,
but will flee from him: for they know
not the voice of strangers. This parable
spake Jesus unto them, but they
understood not what things they were
which he spake unto them. Then said
Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily,
I say unto you, I am the door of the
sheep. All that ever came before me
are thieves and robbers; but the sheep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">{328}</a></span>
did not hear them. I am the door: by
me if any man enter in, he shall be
saved, and shall go in and out, and
find pasture. The thief cometh not but
for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy:
I am come that they might have
life, and that they might have it more
abundantly. I am the good shepherd:
the good shepherd giveth his life for
the sheep. But he that is an hireling,
and not the shepherd, whose own the
sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming,
and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth; and
the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth
the sheep. The hireling fleeth, because
he is an hireling, and careth not
for the sheep. I am the good shepherd,
and know my sheep, and am known of
mine. As the Father knoweth me, even
so know I the Father: and I lay
down my life for the sheep. And other
sheep I have which are not of this
fold: them also I must bring, and they
shall hear my voice; and there shall be
one fold, and one shepherd.</p>

<p class="ritual">And that done, the Bishop shall say unto
them as hereafter followeth:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">{329}</a></span>
You have heard, brethren, as well in
your private examination, (as in the
exhortation which was now made to
you,) and in the holy lessons taken out
of the Gospel, and the writings of the
apostles, of what dignity, and of how
great importance, this office is, whereunto
ye are called. And now again
we exhort you, in the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ, that you have in remembrance
into how high a dignity,
and to how weighty an office ye are
called: that is to say, to be messengers,
watchmen, and stewards of the Lord;
to teach, and to premonish, to feed
and provide for the Lord's family; to
seek for Christ's sheep that are dispersed
abroad, and for his children
who are in the midst of this evil world,
that they may be saved through Christ
forever.</p>

<p>We have good hope that you have
all weighed and pondered these things
with yourselves long before this time;
and that you have clearly determined,
by God's grace, to give yourselves
wholly to this office, whereunto it hath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">{330}</a></span>
pleased God to call you: so that, as
much as lieth in you, you will apply
yourselves wholly to this one thing,
and draw all your cares and studies
this way, and that you will continually
pray to God the Father, through the
mediation of our only Saviour Jesus
Christ, for the heavenly assistance of
the Holy Ghost: that by daily reading
and weighing of the Scriptures, ye
may wax riper and stronger in your
ministry; and that ye may so endeavor
yourselves from time to time to sanctify
the lives of you and yours, and to
fashion them after the rule and doctrine
of Christ, that ye may be wholesome
and godly examples and patterns
for the people to follow.</p>

<p>And now that this present congregation
of Christ, here assembled, may
also understand your minds and wills
in these things, and that this your
promise may the more move you to do
your duties, ye shall answer plainly to
these things, which we, in the name of
God and of his Church, shall demand
of you touching the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">{331}</a></span>
Do you think in your heart that you
are truly called, according to the will
of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the order
of Elders?</p>

<p>Ans. I think so.</p>

<p>The Bishop. Are you persuaded
that the Holy Scriptures contain sufficiently
all doctrine required of necessity
for eternal salvation through
faith in Jesus Christ? And are you
determined, out of the said Scriptures,
to instruct the people committed to
your charge, and to teach nothing, as
required of necessity to eternal salvation,
but that which you shall be persuaded
may be concluded and proved
by the Scriptures?</p>

<p>Ans. I am so persuaded, and have
so determined, by God's grace.</p>

<p>The Bishop. Will you then give
your faithful diligence, always so to
minister the doctrine and sacraments,
and the discipline of Christ, as the
Lord hath commanded?</p>

<p>Ans. I will so do, by the help of
the Lord.</p>

<p>The Bishop. Will you be ready with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">{332}</a></span>
all faithful diligence to banish and
drive away all erroneous and strange
doctrines contrary to God's word; and
to use both public and private monitions
and exhortations, as well to the
sick as to the whole within your
charge, as need shall require, and occasion
shall be given?</p>

<p>Ans. I will, the Lord being my
helper.</p>

<p>The Bishop. Will you be diligent in
prayers, and in reading of the Holy
Scriptures, and in such studies as help
to the knowledge of the same, laying
aside the study of the world and the
flesh?</p>

<p>Ans. I will endeavor so to do, the
Lord being my helper.</p>

<p>The Bishop. Will you be diligent to
frame and fashion yourselves, and
your families, according to the doctrine
of Christ; and to make both
yourselves and them, as much as in
you lieth, wholesome examples and
patterns to the flock of Christ?</p>

<p>Ans. I shall apply myself thereto,
the Lord being my helper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">{333}</a></span>
The Bishop. Will you maintain and
set forward, as much as lieth in you,
quietness, peace, and love, among all
Christian people, and especially among
them that are or shall be committed to
your charge?</p>

<p>Ans. I will so do, the Lord being
my helper.</p>

<p>The Bishop. Will you reverently
obey your chief ministers, unto whom
is committed the charge and government
over you; following with a glad
mind and will their godly admonitions,
submitting yourselves to their godly
judgment?</p>

<p>Ans. I will so do, the Lord being
my helper.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall the Bishop, standing up, say:</p>

<p>Almighty God, who hath given you
this will to do all these things, grant
also unto you strength and power to
perform the same; that he may accomplish
his work which he hath begun in
you, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">After this the congregation shall be desired
secretly in their prayers to make their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">{334}</a></span>
humble supplications to God, for all these
things: for which prayers there shall be
silence kept for a space.</p>

<p class="ritual">After which shall be said by the Bishop,
(the persons to be ordained Elders all
kneeling,) Veni, Creator, Spiritus: the
Bishop beginning, and the Elders and others
that are present answering by verses,
as followeth:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="ritual"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">{335}</a></span>
That done, the Bishop shall pray in this
wise, and say, Let us pray</p>

<p>Almighty God and Heavenly Father,
who, of thine infinite love and goodness
toward us, hast given to us thy
only and most dearly beloved Son Jesus
Christ to be our Redeemer, and the
author of everlasting life; who, after
he had made perfect our redemption
by his death, and was ascended into
heaven, sent abroad into the world his
apostles, prophets, evangelists, doctors
and pastors; by whose labor and
ministry he gathered together a great
flock in all parts of the world, to set
forth the eternal praise of thy holy
name; for these so great benefits of
thy eternal goodness, and for that
thou hast vouchsafed to call these thy
servants here present to the same office
and ministry appointed for the salvation
of mankind, we render unto
thee most hearty thanks: we praise
and worship thee; and we humbly beseech
thee, by the same thy blessed
Son, to grant unto all who either here
or elsewhere call upon thy holy name,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">{336}</a></span>
that we may continue to show ourselves
thankful unto thee for these,
and all other, thy benefits; and that we
may daily increase and go forward in
the knowledge and faith of thee and
thy Son, by the Holy Spirit: so that as
well by these thy ministers, as by them
over whom they shall be appointed thy
ministers, thy holy name may be forever
glorified, and thy blessed kingdom
enlarged, through the same thy Son
Jesus Christ our Lord: who liveth and
reigneth with thee, in the unity of the
same Holy Spirit, world without end.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">When the prayer is done, the Bishop and the Elders present shall lay
their hands severally upon the head of every one that receiveth the
Order of Elders, the receivers humbly kneeling upon their knees, and the
Bishop saying,</p>

<p>The Lord pour upon thee the Holy
Ghost, for the office and work of an
Elder in the Church of God, now committed
unto thee by the imposition of
our hands. And be thou a faithful
dispenser of the word of God, and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">{337}</a></span>
his holy sacraments: in the name of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then the Bishop shall deliver to every one
of them kneeling, the Bible, into his hands,
saying:</p>

<p>Take thou authority to preach the
word of God, and to administer the
holy sacraments in the congregation.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall the Bishop say:</p>

<p>Most merciful Father, we beseech
thee to send upon these thy servants
thy heavenly blessing; that they may
be clothed with righteousness, and that
thy word spoken by their mouths may
have such success, that it may never
be spoken in vain. Grant also, that
we may have grace to hear and receive
what they shall deliver out of thy most
holy word, or agreeable to the same,
as the means of our salvation; that in
all our words and deeds we may seek
thy glory, and the increase of thy
kingdom, through Jesus Christ our
Lord.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">{338}</a></span>
with thy most gracious favor,
and further us with thy continual
help; that in all our works, begun,
continued, and ended in thee, we may
glorify thy holy name, and finally, by
thy mercy, obtain everlasting life,
through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="center">THE BENEDICTION</p>

<p>The peace of God, which passeth all
understanding, keep your hearts and
minds in the knowledge and love of
God, and of his Son Jesus Christ, our
Lord; and the blessing of God Almighty,
the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost, be among you, and remain
with you always.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">If on the same day the Order of Deacons
be given to some, and that of Elders to
others, the Deacons shall be first presented,
and then the Elders. The Collects
shall both be used; first that for Deacons,
then that for Elders. The Epistle shall
be Eph. iv. 7 to 13, as before in this office.
Immediately after which, they that
are to be ordained Deacons shall be examined
and ordained as is above prescribed.
The one of them having read the Gospel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">{339}</a></span>
which shall be St. John x. 1-16, as before
in this office, they that are to be ordained
Elders shall likewise be examined

<h3>THE FORM OF CONSECRATING A
BISHOP.</h3>

<p class="center">THE COLLECT.</p>

<p>Almighty God, who by thy Son Jesus
Christ didst give to thy holy
apostles many excellent gifts, and
didst charge them to feed thy flock:
give grace, we beseech thee, to all the
ministers and pastors of thy Church,
that they may diligently preach thy
word, and duly administer the godly
discipline thereof; and grant to the
people, that they may obediently follow
the same; that all may receive the
crown of everlasting glory, through
Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall be read by one of the Elders.</p>

<p class="center">THE EPISTLE. ACTS xx. 17-35.</p>

<p>From Miletus Paul sent to Ephesus,
and called the Elders of the Church.
And when they were come to him, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">{340}</a></span>
said unto them, Ye know from the first
day that I came into Asia, after what
manner I have been with you at all
seasons, serving the Lord with all humility
of mind, and with many tears
and temptations, which befell me by
the laying in wait of the Jews: and
how I kept back nothing that was profitable
unto you, but have showed you,
and have taught you publicly, and
from house to house, testifying both
to the Jews, and also to the Greeks,
repentance toward God, and faith toward
our Lord Jesus Christ. And now,
behold, I go bound in the spirit unto
Jerusalem, not knowing the things that
shall befall me there: save that the
Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city
saying, that bonds and afflictions abide
me. But none of these things
move me, neither count I my life dear
unto myself, so that I might finish my
course with joy, and the ministry
which I have received of the Lord Jesus,
to testify the gospel of the grace
of God. And now, behold, I know that
ye all, among whom I have gone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">{341}</a></span>
preaching the kingdom of God, shall
see my face no more. Wherefore I
take you to record this day, that I am
pure from the blood of all men. For
I have not shunned to declare unto
you all the counsel of God. Take heed,
therefore, unto yourselves, and to all
the flock over the which the Holy
Ghost hath made you overseers, to
feed the Church of God, which he hath
purchased with his own blood. For I
know this, that after my departing
shall grievous wolves enter in among
you, not sparing the flock. Also of
your own selves shall men arise, speaking
perverse things to draw away disciples
after them. Therefore watch,
and remember, that by the space of
three years I ceased not to warn every
one night and day with tears. And
now, brethren, I commend you to God,
and to the word of his grace, which is
able to build you up, and to give you
an inheritance among all them which
are sanctified. I have coveted no
man's silver, or gold, or apparel. Yea,
ye yourselves know, that these hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">{342}</a></span>
have ministered unto my necessities,
and to them that were with me. I have
showed you all things, how that so laboring
ye ought to support the weak,
and to remember the words of the
Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more
blessed to give than to receive.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then another shall read</p>

<p class="center">THE GOSPEL. ST. JOHN xxi. 15-17.</p>

<p>Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon
son of Jonas, lovest thou me more
than these? He saith unto him, Yea,
Lord: thou knowest that I love thee.
He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.
He saith to him again the second time,
Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?
He saith unto him, Yea, Lord: thou
knowest that I love thee. He saith
unto him the third time, Simon, son of
Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was
grieved because he said unto him the
third time, Lovest thou me? And he
said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all
things, thou knowest that I love thee,
Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">{343}</a></div>

<p class="center">OR THIS. ST. MATT, xxviii. 18-21</p>

<p>Jesus came and spake unto them,
saying, All power is given unto me in
heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore
and teach all nations, baptizing them
in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching
them to observe all things whatsoever
I have commanded you; and lo, I am
with you alway, even unto the end of
the world.</p>

<p class="ritual">After the Gospel and sermon are ended, the
elected person shall be presented by two
Elders unto the Bishop, saying:</p>

<p>We present unto you this holy man,
to be ordained a Bishop.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then the Bishop shall move the congregation
to pray, saying thus to them:</p>

<p>Brethren, it is written in the Gospel
of St. Luke, that our Saviour Christ
continued the whole night in prayer,
before he did choose and send forth his
twelve apostles. It is written also in
the Acts of the Apostles, that the disciples
who were at Antioch did fast
and pray, before they laid hands on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">{344}</a></span>
Paul and Barnabas, and sent them
forth. Let us, therefore, following the
example of our Saviour Christ, and his
apostles, first fall to prayer, before
we admit and send forth this person
presented unto us, to the work whereunto
we trust the Holy Ghost hath
called him.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then shall be said this prayer following:</p>

<p>Almighty God, giver of all good
things, who by the Holy Spirit hast
appointed divers orders of ministers in
thy Church: mercifully behold this thy
servant, now called to the work and
ministry of a Bishop; and replenish
him so with the truth of thy doctrine,
and adorn him with innocency of life,
that, both by word and deed, he may
faithfully serve thee in this office, to
the glory of thy name, and the edifying
and well-governing of thy
Church, through the merits of our Saviour
Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth
with thee and the Holy Ghost,
world without end.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">{345}</a></div>

<p class="ritual">Then the Bishop shall say to him that is to
be ordained:</p>

<p>Brother, forasmuch as the Holy
Scripture commands that we should
not be hasty in laying on hands, and
admitting any person to government
in the Church of Christ, which he hath
purchased with no less price than the
effusion of his own blood: before I
admit you to this administration, I
will examine you on certain articles,
to the end that the congregation present
may have a trial, and bear witness,
how you are minded to behave yourself
in the Church of God.</p>

<p>Are you persuaded that you are
truly called to this ministration, according
to the will of our Lord Jesus
Christ?</p>

<p>Ans. I am so persuaded.</p>

<p>The Bishop. Are you persuaded
that the Holy Scriptures contain sufficiently
all doctrine required of necessity
for eternal salvation, through
faith in Jesus Christ? And are you determined,
out of the same Holy Scriptures,
to instruct the people committed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">{346}</a></span>
to your charge; and to teach or maintain
nothing as required of necessity
to eternal salvation, but that which
you shall be persuaded may be concluded
and proved by the same?</p>

<p>Ans. I am so persuaded, and determined,
by God's grace.</p>

<p>The Bishop. Will you then faithfully
exercise yourself in the same Holy
Scriptures, and call upon God by prayer
for the true understanding of the
same, so as you may be able by them
to teach and exhort with wholesome
doctrine, and to withstand and convince
the gainsayers?</p>

<p>Ans. I will so do, by the help of
God.</p>

<p>The Bishop. Are you ready with
faithful diligence to banish and drive
away all erroneous and strange doctrines
contrary to God's word, and
both privately and openly to call upon
and encourage others to the same?</p>

<p>Ans. I am ready, the Lord being
my helper.</p>

<p>The Bishop. Will you deny all ungodliness
and worldly lusts, and live
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">{347}</a></span>
soberly, righteously, and godly, in this
present world; that you may show
yourself in all things an example of
good works unto others, that the adversary
may be ashamed, having nothing
to say against you?</p>

<p>Ans. I will so do, the Lord being
my helper.</p>

<p>The Bishop. Will you maintain and
set forward, as much as shall lie in
you, quietness, love, and peace among
all men: and such as shall be unquiet,
disobedient, and criminal, within your
district, correct and punish according
to such authority as you have by God's
word, and as shall be committed unto
you?</p>

<p>Ans. I will so do, by the help of
God.</p>

<p>The Bishop. Will you be faithful
in ordaining, sending, or laying hands
upon others?</p>

<p>Ans. I will so be, by the help of
God.</p>

<p>The Bishop. Will you show yourself
gentle, and be merciful, for
Christ's sake, to poor and needy people,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">{348}</a></span>
and to all strangers destitute of
help?</p>

<p>Ans I will so show myself, by God's
help.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then the Bishop shall say:</p>

<p>Almighty God, our Heavenly Father,
who hath given you a good will to do
all these things, grant also unto you
strength and power to perform the
same; that, he accomplishing in you
the good work which he hath begun,
you may be found perfect and irreprehensible
at the last day, through Jesus
Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>Almighty God and most merciful

our redemption by his death, and

down his gifts abundantly upon men,
making some apostles, some prophets,
some evangelists, some pastors and
doctors to the edifying and making
perfect his Church: grant, we beseech
thee, to this thy servant, such grace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">{350}</a></span>
that he may evermore be ready to
spread abroad thy gospel, the glad tidings
of reconciliation with thee, and
use the authority given him, not to destruction,
but to salvation; not to hurt
but to help; so that as a wise and faithful
servant, giving to thy family their
portion in due season, he may at last
be received into everlasting joy,
through Jesus Christ our Lord, who,
with thee and the Holy Ghost, liveth
and reigneth, one God, world without
end.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then the Bishop and Elders present shall
lay their hands upon the head of the elected
person, kneeling before them upon his
knees, the Bishop saying:</p>

<p>The Lord pour upon thee the Holy
Ghost, for the office and work of a
Bishop in the Church of God now committed
unto thee by the imposition of
our hands; in the name of the Father
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>And remember that thou stir
up the grace of God which is given
thee; for God hath not given us the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">{351}</a></span>
spirit of fear, but of power, and love,
and soberness.</p>

<p class="ritual">Then the Bishop shall deliver him the Bible,
saying:</p>

<p>Give heed unto reading, exhortation,
and doctrine. Think upon the things
contained in this book. Be diligent in
them, that the increase coming thereby
may be manifest unto all men. Take
heed unto thyself, and to thy doctrine;
for by so doing thou shalt both save
thyself and them that hear thee. Be
to the flock of Christ a shepherd, not
a wolf; feed them, devour them not.
Hold up the weak, heal the sick, bind
up the broken, bring again the outcasts,
seek the lost. Be so merciful,
that you may not be too remiss; so
minister discipline, that you forget not
mercy; that when the chief Shepherd
shall appear, you may receive the never-fading
crown of glory, through
Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="ritual">Immediately before the benediction shall be
said the following prayer:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">{352}</a></span>
Most merciful Father, we beseech
thee to send down upon this thy servant
thy heavenly blessing; and so endue
him with thy Holy Spirit, that he,
preaching thy word, may not only be
earnest to reprove, beseech, and rebuke
with all patience and doctrine,
but may also be to such as believe a
wholesome example, in word, in conversation,
in love, in faith, in chastity,
and in purity; that, faithfully fulfilling
his course, at the latter day he may receive
the crown of righteousness laid
up by the Lord, the righteous Judge,
who liveth and reigneth, one God with
the Father and the Holy Ghost, world
without end.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings
with thy most gracious favor, and
further us with thy continual help;
that in all our works, begun, continued,
and ended in thee, we may glorify
thy holy name, and finally, by thy
mercy, obtain everlasting life, through
Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">{353}</a></div>

<p class="center">THE BENEDICTION.</p>

<p>The peace of God, which passeth all
understanding, keep your hearts and
minds in the knowledge and love of
God, and of his Son Jesus Christ our
Lord; and the blessing of God Almighty,
the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost, be among you, and remain
with you always.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<h4>III. THE PRESIDENT'S DUTIES</h4>

<p>1. At the appointed hour the President
shall take the chair, and after devotional
exercises, a quorum being present, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">{366}</a></span>
minutes of the preceding session shall be
read and approved. The President for the
day shall then take up the business of the
Conference in the regular order according
to these Rules of Order, and other rules and
regulations adopted by the General Conference.</p>

<p>2. The President shall decide all questions
of order, and his decision shall be subject
to an appeal to the General Conference.
And when an appeal from his decision has
been made, such appeal shall be decided
without debate, provided the President shall
be allowed to state the grounds of his decision
and the appellant the grounds of his
dissent.</p>

<p>3. Unless otherwise ordered by the Conference,
the President shall appoint all committees.</p>

<p>4. When the President accords the floor
to a member, he shall distinctly announce
the name of said member and the Annual
Conference he represents.</p>

<h4>IV. ORDER OF BUSINESS</h4>

<p>The following shall be the Order of Business:</p>

<p>1. Devotions.</p>

<p>2. Reading the Journal of the previous
session.</p>

<p>3. The calling of the roll of Conferences
in alphabetical order for the presentation
of appeals, resolutions, and miscellaneous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">{367}</a></span>
business for immediate consideration. The
member introducing a proposition under this
call may speak to it if it be seconded. If
a motion to refer be made, it shall be entertained
and decided without debate; or if
the question of consideration be raised immediately
after the proposition has been offered,
and immediately before the person
who introduced the proposition has spoken,
the question of consideration shall then be
put without debate. If there be a two-third
vote against consideration, the proposition
will not be entertained.</p>

<p>4. Reports of the standing committees,
then those of special committees; provided
always, that each call shall have been completed
before either preceding one shall be
repeated.</p>

<p>5. Miscellaneous business.</p>

<h4>V. DUTIES AND PRIVILEGES OF MEMBERS</h4>

<p>1. When a member rises to speak or to
present to the Conference any matter he
shall respectfully address the President,
and shall not proceed until recognized by
him. The member desiring to speak must
address the President from the place assigned
the delegation of his Annual Conference.</p>

<p>2. The President may call to order any
speaker who may be out of order. There
shall be no unwarranted interruption of the
speaker by any other member. However,
any member may call the attention of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">{368}</a></span>
President when he deems any speaker out
of order. Also any member has the privilege
of explanation when he is misrepresented
by the speaker.</p>

<p>3. When a speaker raises a question of
privilege it shall not be in order for him
to speak to it until the President shall have
decided it a question of privilege. The
following are questions of privilege: matters
relating to the rights and welfare of
the individual member or of the whole body.
Such matters must be imperative in character
in order to justify the interruption
of the regular order.</p>

<p>4. No member shall speak more than
twice on any question without the consent
of two-thirds of the members present; nor
may he make a second speech until every
member choosing to speak thereto shall
have spoken. In no case shall any speech
be more than five minutes in length unless
by consent of the Conference, provided,
however, that the chairman of a committee
making a report or one of its members selected
by the chairman or the committee
shall in all cases be entitled to close the
debate with a five minutes speech, despite
the motion to lay the report on the table,
or the call for the previous question. When
a report consists of two or more propositions,
the right of the committee, its chairman
or its appointee, shall be the same as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">{369}</a></span>
above defined, even though the propositions
be debated and voted on separately.</p>

<p>5. No member shall absent himself from
the sessions of the Conference without leave
unless he is sick or unable to attend.</p>

<h4>VI. MOTIONS AND RESOLUTIONS</h4>

the President, Secretary or any member
request it, any motion shall be reduced to
writing.</p>

<p>2. All written motions and communications
to the Conference shall be read by a
Secretary of the Conference.</p>

<p>3. All motions and resolutions when
properly introduced and seconded and all

deemed the property of the Conference. But
the mover of any resolution or motion may
withdraw it at any time before amendment
or decision.</p>

<p>6. The motion for the previous question
cannot be laid on the table.</p>

<p>7. It shall be in order to move only one
amendment to an amendment. But it
shall be in order to move a substitute to
the main question, and the substitute may
be amended. If the substitute is accepted,
it shall take the place of the original question.</p>

<p>8. The motion to adjourn is always in
order except in five instances, to wit:</p>

<p class="subpara">(1) When a member has the floor.</p>

<p class="subpara">(2) When a question is about to be put
or a vote is about to be taken, or final decision
reached.</p>

<p class="subpara">(3) When a question is pending on sustaining
the demand for the previous question.</p>

<p class="subpara">(4) When the previous question has been
called and sustained and action is pending.</p>

<p class="subpara">(5) When a motion to adjourn has been
voted down and no business or debate has
intervened.</p>

<p>9. Any member who in the first instance
voted on a motion or resolution with
the prevailing side is entitled to make the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">{371}</a></span>
motion for a reconsideration, but no one
else shall.</p>

<p>10. All resolutions contemplating verbal
alterations of the Discipline shall state
the language of the paragraph and the line
to be altered, and also the language to be
substituted. Two hours each day or such
amount of time as is necessary to deal with
the disciplinary changes offered, shall be
given to the revision of the Discipline, taking
it chapter by chapter, and all amendments
shall be offered while the section is
under consideration; and each section shall
be amended and passed before proceeding to
another.</p>

<h4>VII. VOTING</h4>

<p>1. Unless excused for special reasons by
the Conference, every member within the bar
of the Conference must vote upon every
question submitted for voting. Voting shall
be done by standing, or by "yeas" and
"nays" except that voting on all questions

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
